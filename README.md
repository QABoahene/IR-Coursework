# IR-Coursework
This is a project that focuses on buiding a vertical search engine for news articles from RSS feeds. An automated crawler developed to crawl the features of the articles which went through text preprocessing methods like indexing, lowercase transformation, lemmatisation, stop words and puntuation removal.
The crawled articles went through a rank retrieval process for the query processing part of the project. 
Lastly, a news classifier was developed as a machine learning component of the project in order to tag the quried article by its category.

Technologies used include python, Jupyter Notebook, feedparser, nltk, pandas, numpy, genism, sklearn.
