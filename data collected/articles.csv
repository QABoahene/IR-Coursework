Police said they are “currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related,” although the circumstances are still unclear.Read More: Police Close London Bridge Amid Reports of Stabbing, Gun ShotsEarlier the prime minister sought to recapture the spirit of the 2016 referendum as he tried to convince Brexit supporters he still needs their votes even though polls show him on course for election victory next month. He promised tougher rules on foreign takeovers and the provision of state aid to help British companies.Johnson warned against complacency, saying there is still a risk of a coalition government led by Jeremy Corbyn, even after polling analysis suggested the Labour party could lose districts it has held for decades.Must Read: The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionFor more on the election visit ELEC.Key Developments:Johnson and Michael Gove appear at a press conference in London alongside anti-EU former Labour MP Gisela Stuart in a reprise of the 2016 Brexit referendumStuart urges traditional Labour supporters to vote Conservative to deliver BrexitTories pledge tougher rules on foreign takeovers; Johnson says U.K. must be open to Chinese investment but must strike a “balance” on security concernsLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson speaks in Cardiff at 2:30 p.m. on interfaith relations and policingThe BBC holds a 7-way party debate at 7 p.m. -- though Johnson and Corbyn will not take partThere is a 71% chance of a Conservative majority, according to bookmaker LadbrokesJohnson returning to Central London (3:35 p.m.)Boris Johnson is returning to his office in central London after police shot a man at London Bridge and a number of people were injured.“The prime minister is on his way back to No 10 from his constituency where he will receive further updates on the London Bridge incident,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said in a statement.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also expressed his concern. “Shocking reports from London Bridge. My thoughts are with those caught up in the incident. Thank you to the police and emergency services who are responding,” he said on Twitter.Johnson Being Kept Updated on London Incident (3:10 p.m.)Boris Johnson said he’s being kept informed about the unfolding incident at London Bridge, in which there have been reports of gunshots and stabbings. Police said they are “currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related.”Armed police locked down the bridge and evacuated the area. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that after being called to a stabbing at a premises nearby, they had detained one man. A number of people have been injured, they said.“I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response,” Johnson said on Twitter.Home Secretary Priti Patel also posted on Twitter, saying she’s “very concerned by ongoing incident at London Bridge. My thoughts are with all affected.” She urged people to follow the advice of the police. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he’s in “close contact” with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.Corbyn in Fresh Attack on Billionaires (12:45 p.m.)Jeremy Corbyn opened a new broadside on billionaires opposing his plans for a re-distributive socialist economy after The Daily Mail and General Trust bought the i newspaper in a 50 million pound deal ($64.5 million).“Two billionaire press barons now own half of the top 10 daily newspapers,” Corbyn said in a posting on Twitter. “Remember this when they attack Labour’s plan to make the super-rich pay their fair share.”“We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high quality and politically independent editorial style,” DMGT said in a statement on its acquisition of the i newspaper.Free Trade Group Attacks State Aid Proposals (12:20 p.m.)The Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which had close links with former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said it was disappointed with Boris Johnson’s plan to change state aid rules and procurement provisions to make it easier to support British companies, calling it a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the European Union in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute. “Making a profit is a proof of the value added to society, and there must be no business that is too big to fail.”Tories Pledge Tougher Foreign Takeover Rules (12:05 p.m.)The Conservatives plan to strengthen protections against foreign takeovers of British companies, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said, in answer to a question about Chinese investment in the U.K.“We certainly don’t believe that the current provisions which are in place are robust enough,” Gove said at a press conference. He said he’s undertaken to “strengthen” a unit in his department that examines foreign takeovers, and “strengthen protections in the future.”Speaking alongside him, Boris Johnson agreed, before saying the country must strike a “balance” between “continuing to be open to investment from China” and making sure the U.K. doesn’t do anything “that prejudices our critical national infrastructure, our security, or do anything that would compromise our ability to cooperate with five-eyes security partners.”“Those are the parameters,” Johnson said. “I am very, very far from a Sinophobe. I want to have good relations with China, but there are clear difficulties and clear boundaries that we have to set.”U.K.’s No-Deal Preparations to Continue (12 p.m.)Boris Johnson confirmed the U.K. will continue to make preparations for a disorderly exit from the European Union. “Of course the preparations will remain extant,” he said. “There’s no reason to dismantle them.”He described the preparations which he put in place prior to the Oct. 31 deadline as being “thoroughly useful” in achieving the deal made with the EU, as it convinced Brussels the U.K. was “in earnest” about leaving.Johnson said he is confident of completing a deal with the EU by the end of 2020 and “sees no reason” to extend that deadline, meaning the U.K. crashing out without a deal is still a possibility.State Aid Plan Compatible With EU: Johnson (11:50 a.m.)Taking questions from the press after his speech, Boris Johnson said that “of course” the U.K.’s new state aid rules (see 11:35 a.m.) would be compatible with those of the European Union, dismissing the idea that they could endanger a new free trade deal with the bloc.“Were there to be any issues arising, then as you know, under any big free trade deal, there’s a joint committee to arbitrate on whether some unfair subsidy or dispensation has been made,” Johnson said. “But it would be a committee of sovereign equals.”Johnson later said he believed in competition and in a “level playing field.”Tories Vow to Change Public Procurement (11:40 a.m)The Tories vowed to break away from EU state aid rules that the party said have a “chilling effect” on government support for industry, because of the need to wait for “months or years” for decisions on whether measures by member states are permissible or not.Existing rules “mean that the U.K. government cannot take steps to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger,” the Conservative Party said in the statement. New rules will be developed in consultation with British businesses, it said.The Tories promised a new state aid system that sets out clear principles when the government will intervene, based on the U.K.’s needs. Ministers will have “more discretion” over decisions, which they will be able to take within “days.” A new government body would be set up to manage the system, the party said.On public procurement, the Tories pledged to ditch “absurdly complex” EU rules with their “pointless tendering requirements.” It also promised “simpler and cheaper” regulations that are “geared towards supporting local business and promoting British business.” The new system will be in place by Jan. 2021.Tories Announce State Aid Plans (11:35 a.m.)The Conservatives unveiled a package of measures that they described as “immediate steps to realize the benefits of Brexit,” including a pledge to overhaul the country’s state aid system to make it “faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble.”A Tory government will also change public procurement policy to support local businesses and promote a “buy British” approach for public bodies that purchase food, in an effort to back farmers, the party said in an email.“People voted to take back control -- and we want to deliver that change,” Johnson said in a statement. “One of the crucial ways we will do that is by improving our rules so that we can back British businesses and unleash their true potential.”Stuart Tells Labour Voters to Back Johnson (11:30 a.m.)Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who helped run the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, urged traditional Labour voters to back the Conservatives in what she called the Dec. 12 “Brexit election.”“Voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future,” Stuart said as she stood alongside Johnson and Michael Gove. “Rather, it is the best option.”Labour Step Up Pressure Over Johnson Comments (10:40 a.m.)Labour criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson over past remarks he made about single mothers in a column from the 1990s (See 10 a.m.)“Boris Johnson’s refusal to apologize for his hateful comments about single mothers, their children and working class men is an absolute disgrace,” Labour’s education spokeswoman, Angela Rayner, who has herself been a single mother, said in a statement. “He tried to deny what he wrote, but the evidence is there in black and white for us all to see, proving once again that he’s a liar as well as a sexist.”Johnson Signals to Trump to Stay Quiet (10:15 a.m.)Ahead of Donald Trump’s visit to the U.K. next week, Boris Johnson said the two allies “traditionally” do not get involved in each others’ domestic politics -- an apparent signal to the U.S. president not to say anything that could potentially undermine the Conservative Party’s election campaign.“We have very close relationships with the United States at every level of government, but what we don’t do traditionally -- as loving allies and friends -- is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,” Johnson told LBC radio.The comment comes amid Tory party fears of an intervention by the president in the run-up to the Dec. 12 vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is using Johnson’s links to the president and pursuit of a post-Brexit U.S. trade as a central attack line in the campaign, especially on the potential dangers to Britain’s state-run National Health Service.Johnson pointed out that former President Barack Obama’s intervention in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign didn’t help the government’s argument for staying in the European Union. Obama’s comments were “not entirely conducive to the good of that cause,” he said.Johnson Under Fire for Controversial Comments (10 a.m.)Boris Johnson said the quotation of comments from his newspaper columns about Muslims, black people and single mothers were a “distortion” of his true views. In a 1995 article republished this week, he blamed single mothers for “producing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children.”“These are 25 year old quotations culled from articles written before I was even in politics,” Johnson said in response to an angry call from a single mother to a phone-in on LBC. “Almost invariably when you look at these articles what the actual piece is saying the opposite of what is claimed.” Johnson also refused to say how many children he has and whether he is involved in all of their lives.The description of single mothers was not the first time Johnson’s comments have attracted condemnation. He has previously come under fire for referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles,” while last year he used the terms “bank robber” and “letterbox” to describe Muslim women who wear burqas.Johnson also refused to say whether Jacob Rees-Mogg would still be in his cabinet if he wins the election after the leader of the House of Commons suggested people could have survived the Grenfell Tower fire if they’d shown “common sense” to escape. “I’m not going to get into measuring up the curtains type conversations,” Johnson said.Johnson Defends Tory Plans on NHS (9:40 a.m.)During his Q&A appearance on LBC radio, Boris Johnson was repeatedly challenged on his Conservative Party’s plans for the National Health Service. He acknowledged that a pledge to add 50,000 nurses actually includes persuading 19,000 to stay in the profession -- a discrepancy that opposition parties have said shows the Tories are misleading voters.“I do understand the controversy about this,” Johnson said, referring to the 19,000 figure. “The risk is that they will leave the profession and we’re putting in the funds to ensure they will stay.”Britain’s beloved state-run NHS is a key battleground in the election campaign after Labour accused Johnson of using it as a bargaining chip in talks with the U.S. on a post-Brexit trade deal. The prime minister reiterated on Friday that’s not the case, calling it “Bermuda Triangle stuff” from Corbyn’s party.Johnson was also on the back foot over his widely disputed plan to build 40 new hospitals, with opposition parties arguing the real number is only six. The prime minister was forced to acknowledge that some voters will not regard hospital refurbishments and upgrades as new hospitals. He also said the Conservative manifesto does not include a plan to resolve the crisis in social care because the precise details have not been “thrashed out” -- despite it being a key pledge in his first speech as prime minister.Johnson: Working on ‘About a Dozen’ Trade Deals (9:15 a.m.)Boris Johnson could not give a figure for how many trade deals the U.K. has ready ahead of its departure from the EU. “I can’t give the answer to how many deals are actually formalized,” he said in a phone-in with listeners on LBC radio. “There are a number that are virtually ready to go.”“I imagine we have about a dozen we’re currently working on,” he said, naming China, India, New Zealand and Australia as examples.If his Conservative Party wins a working majority, the U.K. will leave the EU on Jan. 31, Johnson said. A trade deal will also be agreed with the bloc by the end of 2020, he said: “I see no reason to go beyond that deadline,” he told listeners.Williamson Denies Tory Threat to Channel 4 (9 a.m.)Education Secretary Gavin Williamson denied the Conservative Party is threatening to review Channel 4’s broadcasting license following its decision not to allow Cabinet minister Michael Gove to sub in for Boris Johnson in a leaders’ debate on climate change on Thursday.Speaking on BBC radio, Williamson said the party has raised a complaint with the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. The row came after Johnson declined to appear in the debate, sending Gove in his place. Channel 4 refused to allow Gove, who appeared at the venue with his own television crew, to take part -- on the basis that the invitation was to the leaders of the political parties.“The Conservative Party isn’t threatening Channel 4, we’re raising a complaint with Ofcom which is perfectly legitimate,” Williamson said. “Frankly they reduced the quality of the debate that happened yesterday by refusing to let Michael Gove go on.” The Telegraph cited a source in the Tory party it didn’t identify as saying Channel 4’s public broadcasting license is under threat.McDonnell: Johnson ‘Running Scared’ (Earlier)Labour economy spokesman John McDonnell said Boris Johnson is “running scared” from scrutiny after the prime minister refused to attend a leaders debate on climate change on Thursday evening. He has also refused to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, who has the reputation of being one of the BBC’s most forensic interviewers.“The reason he is doing it is because he thinks like, you know, his Bullingdon Club friends, that they’re above the rest of us,” McDonnell said. “Because he knows that Andrew Neil will take him apart. He’s running scared. But even if he does it now, he’s played you because he’s pushing it later and later beyond the postal vote returns.”The Conservatives wrote to OfCom, the media regulator, on Thursday evening to complain that Channel 4, the host of the climate debate, had replaced Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate.Labour is not changing its strategy, McDonnell said, denying reports that the party is switching its focus to leave voting areas after polling showed that it was set to lose seats in its north of England hearltlands.Earlier:The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionU.K. Consumer Confidence Lowest Heading Into Election Since 2010Johnson Warns Against Complacency Over Lead: U.K. Campaign TrailTories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate DebateTo contact the reporters on this story: Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.net;Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net;Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/johnson-warns-against-complacency-over-090218226.html,29/11/2019

Photograph: Saumya Khandelwal/ReutersIn countries across the world, algorithms and artificial intelligence are taking over welfare payments systems. Governments often make these changes quietly, with little public debate or accountability. But they affect millions, with serious – and possibly even fatal – results.In our special project Automating Poverty, we cast a light on the way digital innovation is threatening the poor.Our correspondent Rebecca Ratcliffe travelled 1,300km from Delhi to the east of India to investigate the country’s vast biometrics scheme, Aadhaar. She interviewed the family of Motka Manjhi, who died from starvation after his food subsidies were stopped because his thumbprint wasn’t recognised by the Aadhaar biometrics database.In Australia, Luke Henriques-Gomes reported on the families who are informed by text message that their payments are suspended, sometimes in error and with no human to complain to.In the UK, Robert Booth and Sarah Marsh spent the best part of six weeks digging into the automation of welfare systems.After publishing our series, we received scores of emails from social scientists, government officials and welfare recipients around the world. Writers from India, Spain, the UK, the US and other countries shared their experiences.At the United Nations general assembly in New York, the Guardian mediated a panel discussion on the human rights challenges of the digital age.Automating Poverty is one of the reporting projects we funded with the $1m in reader donations we raised during our end-of-year drive last winter.Now through January, we hope to raise $1.5m to fund more journalism like this in 2020.

During the visit, Trump&#39;s first to Afghanistan, he announced that the U.S. and the Taliban have reopened peace talks. He said he believes the Taliban want a truce in America&#39;s longest war. &quot;We&#39;re meeting with them,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And we&#39;re saying it has to be a ceasefire.&quot; Trump had cut off talks with the Taliban in September and canceled a secret meeting between Taliban and Afghan leaders after a flurry of violence. During Trump&#39;s 3 1/2 hours at Bagram Air Field, Trump also served turkey to U.S. soldiers, who cheered him when he entered the dining hall. About 12,000 American troops remain in Afghanistan. [The Associated Press] 2.Police restored school administrators&#39; control of Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Friday, declaring that there were no pro-democracy protesters left on the wrecked campus after a two-week siege. Police arrested hundreds of protesters during the showdown. On Thursday, a team of about 400 officers conducted a sweep of the university, and found nearly 4,000 firebombs, 921 gas canisters, and 588 containers of chemicals, including acid and other corrosive liquids. The transfer of control back to school officials marked the end of one of the most intense clashes between protesters and police in a month of escalating unrest following the death of a student who fell from a parking structure during a police operation. [The New York Times, South China Morning Post] 3.North Korea on Thursday launched two short-range projectiles into the waters off its east coast, South Korea&#39;s military said. &quot;Our military expresses its strong regret over (the launches) and urges (North Korea) to immediately stop acts that escalate military tensions,&quot; said Maj. Gen. Jeon Dong Jin, a senior operations officer at Seoul&#39;s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The missile test came three days after North Korea said its soldiers had held artillery drills near a disputed sea boundary. The latest missile launches were the 13th public weapons test conducted by North Korea this year as Pyongyang pushes for a new U.S. proposal to resume stalled talks on trading nuclear concessions for sanctions relief. [The Associated Press, The Washington Post] 4.The European Parliament on Thursday passed a symbolic measure declaring a &quot;climate emergency.&quot; The move raises pressure on member states to take action to curb emissions blamed for climate change ahead of a United Nations climate summit starting Dec. 2 in Spain. In recent months, hundreds of regional and local administrations have approved similar declarations, but Thursday&#39;s vote was significant because the European lawmakers who passed the measure represent 500 million people. &quot;Five years ago, no one would have expected the European Parliament to declare a climate emergency, so there&#39;s some progress,&quot; said Sebastian Mang of Greenpeace. Dissenters in the 429-225 vote objected to the use of the word &quot;emergency,&quot; suggesting the use of &quot;urgency&quot; instead. [The Washington Post, Reuters] 5.The holiday shopping season kicks off on Friday with traditional Black Friday sales. Many retailers got a jump on the competition by getting started with deep discounts on Thanksgiving Day, and analysts forecast data to show that online shoppers spent a record $4 billion on Thanksgiving. The total had already reached $2.1 billion as of 5 p.m. Thursday, a 20.2 percent increase compared to the same point last year. Demand was so high on Thursday that Costco&#39;s website and app were briefly hampered by heavy traffic. Black Friday is continuing to evolve, as many stores try to snag a bigger share of holiday sales by cutting prices days or even weeks before what used to be a one-day shopping frenzy. Shoppers are expected to spend up to $731 billion in November and December, roughly 4 percent more than in the same period last year. [USA Today, MarketWatch] 6.Powerful winter storms hammered parts of the country on Thursday, complicating Thanksgiving travel. Heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5, a major highway in Southern California, leaving dozens of vehicles stuck with snow still falling. The highway, which joins Southern California with the rest of the state, was reopened later in the day, but forecasters warned more snow and rain could fall in the area. A so-called bomb cyclone, with a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure, brought up to four feet of snow in some mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest.

[Reuters] 7.Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, on Thursday reiterated his denial of sexual misconduct allegations made by three women in an article jointly published Wednesday by ProPublica and Portland Monthly magazine. In the article, Sondland said the claims were &quot;concocted&quot; for &quot;political purposes.&quot; One of the women said Sondland backtracked on plans to invest in her business after she rejected his advances during a tour of a hotel he owns. Another accuser, a work associate, said Sondland exposed himself to her. The third, who is 27 years younger than Sondland, said he forcibly kissed her when they met to discuss a possible job. One of the accusers, Nicole Vogel, owns Portland Monthly. The alleged incidents took place years ago, before Sondland was named as Trump&#39;s E.U. ambassador.

President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on Wednesday. It requires an annual review to confirm that the former British colony still has enough autonomy to justify its special trade status. &quot;I guess Trump wanted to give us a Thanksgiving present, and we&#39;re glad to accept,&quot; said Wong Yiu-chung, a Lingnan University politics professor who attended the rally.

Johnson pushed for the early election hoping to break a stalemate over Britain&#39;s planned exit from the European Union. Trump has already made controversial comments in the vote, saying in October that Johnson should join forces with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and that the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn would be &quot;so bad&quot; for the country.

Gobright and a climbing partner, Aidan Jacobson, fell about 20 feet to a ledge after their rope got stuck, but Jacobson landed in a bush, which broke his fall. &quot;It was basically a blur,&quot; Jacobson, 26, told Outside magazine. &quot;He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge.&quot; Gobright fell nearly 985 feet to his death, which the State Department confirmed in a statement, saying, &quot;We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss.&quot; [CNN, The New York Times]More stories from theweek.com  Democrats are running into Trump&#39;s economic buzzsaw  5 gut-bustingly funny cartoons about politics and Thanksgiving  Impeachment is failing.

The candidates representing the “remainers” are a duo made up of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Klara Geywitz. Siding with the “exiters” are Norbert Walter-Borjans, a former state finance chief and left-wing lawmaker Saskia Esken. The result of the vote will be announced Saturday evening and the winner confirmed at a party convention a week later.Germany’s Coalition on the Cusp of Collapse: What’s Next?The crises bedeviling Germany’s ruling parties coincides not only with Merkel’s final phase in office but also with the rise of far-right populists and environmentalist to rival them. Another bout of political uncertainty could hamper Germany’s response in a possible economic crisis as well as its presidency of the European Council in the second half of next year.Investors will be watching the result of Saturday’s elections. Centrist, and particularly Socialist parties throughout Europe have been struggling as well. The head of the Austrian Social Democratic party, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, is under pressure after losing an election in which she couldn’t score against a scandal-ridden right wing. Voices asking for her head got louder when she fired dozens of party officials to help stem its growing debt.Scholz and Geywitz have argued that despite the pain of compromise, the party is achieving more from the cabinet bench than it would in opposition. Walter-Borjans and Esken, who favor increased spending and taxing the rich, have championed a restive party base that wants to return the party to its working-class roots.Under the lead of the victorious tandem the party will formally evaluate its alliance with Merkel’s CDU at the Dec. 6-8 convention.Both staying and leaving come with risks. Polling well below the 20.5% support it garnered in 2017, the SPD could see its parliamentary base shrink dramatically in a possible snap election. Sitting tight may simply lead to a further loss in support.The SPD has 13%, half the support garnered by Merkel’s bloc and well behind the 22% for the Greens, according to a YouGov survey from Wednesday.Rather than a straight vote on breaking up the coalition, party leaders may opt to set out conditions for staying, such as a departure from balanced-budget policies, an increased minimum wage, or more spending on social welfare. The CDU-led bloc could enter into a prolonged negotiating process or find itself unable to fulfill the SPD’s conditions.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who temporarily defused critics seeking to sideline her, told party delegates in Leipzig last week that she would refuse to renegotiate the coalition agreement that the two factions completed in March 2018.UnacceptableShould Walter-Borjans and Esken win, demands on Merkel could include a call to scrap fiscal discipline and impose a minimum wage of 12 euros ($13.20) -- almost surely red lines for Merkel’s camp, according to Manfred Guellner, the director at Berlin-based pollster Forsa.“That would be unacceptable for the CDU and the grand coalition would sooner or later break apart,” Guellner said in an interview.Depending on the details of the demands, the coalition could rumble on for weeks or months, even if some of the coalition members run out of patience.“All day long the SPD asks itself ‘do I want all this here’,” Jens Spahn, the 39-year-old CDU health minister and conservative flag-bearer, said in Leipzig. “My simple expectation is that whoever leads the SPD after this convention, that they decide what they want.”Read more:Germany’s Finance Minister Advances to Run-Off for Party ChiefGermany’s Balanced Budget May End Finance Minister’s CareerMerkel Party Leader’s Ultimatum Contains Rebels, For Now(Adds reference to investors in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Arne Delfs and Boris Groendahl.To contact the reporters on this story: Birgit Jennen in Berlin at bjennen1@bloomberg.net;Patrick Donahue in Berlin at pdonahue1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Raymond ColittFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/merkels-fate-rests-disgruntled-members-040001796.html,29/11/2019

On Thursday, it launched two short-range rockets, its 13th rocket or missile test since May.&quot;Today, we sit on top of a live volcano,&quot; said Robert L. Carlin, a former nuclear negotiator at the State Department and longtime North Korea observer, describing a rapidly deteriorating situation on the peninsula during a lecture this month at Yonsei University in Seoul, the South Korean capital. &quot;We don&#39;t have a lot of time to back away.&quot;In the past month, North Korea has warned that the Trump administration should not even &quot;dream of&quot; discussing denuclearization without first ending its &quot;hostile&quot; policies, including smothering economic sanctions. It swore &quot;shocking punishment&quot; if Washington were to ignore the year-end deadline.Senior American diplomats do not appear to share that urgency. To them, it&#39;s just posturing.&quot;I don&#39;t remember a time limit being set. Is this the North Koreans?&quot; David R. Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told reporters in Tokyo last month, admitting to being unaware of the deadline. &quot;But I would say that the North Koreans do one thing a lot, and that&#39;s bluff.&quot;When Washington has addressed the January deadline, it has called it an &quot;artificial&quot; time limit. And that leaves analysts fearing the outbreak of another crisis on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea has not been explicit about what might happen after Dec. 31, except that Kim has warned of finding a &quot;new way&quot; if Washington persists with sanctions and tries to force an unpalatable denuclearization deal.Some analysts say the deadline shows how badly Kim wants a deal so that he can finally deliver on a promise to his people to lift sanctions and rebuild ​the country&#39;s ailing economy. North Korea&#39;s increasingly urgent statements in recent weeks are designed to pressure Washington to return to the negotiating table with a more flexible proposal, they say.&quot;The North Koreans are telling the United States: &#39;We will have to do something very bad unless you do something for us by the end of the year, so please help us stop ourselves,&#39; &quot; Kim Hyung-ki, a former vice unification minister of South Korea, said during a forum in Seoul last month.Kim&#39;s &quot;new way&quot; could mean resuming tests of nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, analysts say. Trump has often bragged about the testing moratorium, citing it as his biggest achievement in his on-off diplomacy with Kim. Recently, the United States and South Korea decided to postpone a joint air force exercise that has alarmed the North.If North Korea launches another long-range missile, it will set off more United Nations sanctions. It would also invite harsh reaction from Washington, perhaps even a return to the type of &quot;fire and fury&quot; threats Trump once used as the United States and North Korea appeared to be hurtling to the brink of war.With its increasingly strident demands in recent weeks, North Korea is playing a delicate game in denying itself an escape hatch from Kim&#39;s year-end deadline. And it comes as Washington is consumed by the impeachment hearings, which limits Trump&#39;s room for diplomacy with the North.That combination makes the situation volatile, escalating the risk that either side could miscalculate, officials and analysts worry.&quot;We could see a possibility of going back to some of the more provocative steps that preceded the start of this diplomacy,&quot; Stephen E. Biegun, Washington&#39;s special representative for North Korea, said last week during a confirmation hearing on his nomination as deputy secretary of state. &quot;I think that would be a huge mistake and a missed opportunity by the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea.&quot;Other analysts say Kim would most likely first take actions that do not breach the moratorium on nuclear or long-range missile tests but would still deliver a strong message to Washington. That could include restarting plutonium-producing nuclear reactors in Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, or launching short- or medium-range missiles.A nuclear or ICBM test would also provoke China at a time when Kim needs its help more than ever to blunt the pain of international sanctions. Last year, 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited North Korea, a 50% increase from 2017, providing badly needed cash for Pyongyang, according to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, citing Chinese customs data.If Kim ends his diplomacy with Trump, he could, at least in the short term, &quot;muddle through with the help of China,&quot; said Lee Jung-chul, a North Korea expert at Soongsil University in Seoul. &quot;It will be difficult for the North to attempt a provocation, given the importance of its relations with China.&quot;North Korea has not specified what it seeks in demanding that Washington drop its &quot;hostile policy.&quot; It has long indicated that it wants international sanctions lifted and an end to joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. In the past, it has also called for the United States to end its military presence in and around South Korea.But in recent statements, North Korea has only hardened its demands, further dimming the prospects for dialogue.It said it had already taken enough confidence-building steps, such as the test moratorium, the shutting down of its underground nuclear test site and its return of American remains from the Korean War. It said Trump should expect no more gifts &quot;he can boast of&quot; and that he should instead keep the promises he made in his Singapore summit last year with Kim, like ending regular joint military exercises with South Korea that the North sees as war preparations.Analysts worry that with talks having stalled, North Korea will continue to produce more nuclear fuel and warheads. As its nuclear arsenal increases, the cost of denuclearization continues to rise.&quot;You might argue, how can we reward a bad guy like North Korea?&quot; said Jun Bong-geun, acting president of the government-run Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. &quot;But sanctions and pressure alone have never worked on North Korea. You also have to offer incentives.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/time-running-trumps-north-korean-141244409.html,29/11/2019

The bloc puts strict limits on state aid to prevent unfair competition, and has no reason to make an exception for the U.K.“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the EU in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which was closely linked to former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He branded Johnson’s plans a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”Despite riling some allies, the prime minister’s message on state aid and favoring British companies may help win support in Labour-held seats in England’s north and midlands he needs for a parliamentary majority. Even as opinions polls show him well on course to do so, many of these local races still look set to to be close.Deal PressureJohnson, who pledged again to leave the EU by the end of January, needs to reach a deal with the U.K.’s biggest trading partner by the time current arrangements expire at the end of next year. But the further Britain departs from the bloc’s labor, environment and state-aid standards, the harder it will be to reach an agreement that will give U.K. companies access to the European market.The Conservatives said the EU’s current state-aid rules have a “chilling effect” because governments have to wait for the European Commission to approve any measures, delaying measures “to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger.”The Tories promised a new system that sets out clear principles for government intervention, based on the U.K.’s needs. Ministers will have “more discretion” over decisions, which they will be able to take within “days.” A new government body would be created to manage the system, the party said.Taking questions from the press after a speech in London, Johnson said that “of course” the new rules would be compatible with those of the EU, adding that, even with the new rules, he is committed to keeping a “level playing field” -- a key requirement for the bloc.‘Sovereign Equals’“Were there to be any issues arising, then as you know, under any big free trade deal, there’s a joint committee to arbitrate on whether some unfair subsidy or dispensation has been made,” Johnson said. “But it would be a committee of sovereign equals.”The promise on takeovers follows a spate of controversial acquisitions of British companies, including defense contractor Cobham Plc and satellite operator Inmarsat Plc, by overseas bidders -- a trend fueled in part by a decline in the pound since the Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, China’s Huawei Technologies Co. is vying to be part of Britain’s future mobile communications network -- something the U.S. has opposed.Asked specifically about Chinese investment, Johnson said the U.K. must strike a “balance” between “continuing to be open to investment from China” and making sure nothing happens “that prejudices our critical national infrastructure, our security, or do anything that would compromise our ability to cooperate with five-eyes security partners.”On public procurement, the Tories pledged to ditch “absurdly complex” EU rules with their “pointless tendering requirements.” The parties also promised “simpler and cheaper” regulations that are “geared toward supporting local business and promoting British business.”&#92;--With assistance from Alex Morales, Greg Ritchie and Tim Ross.To contact the reporter on this story: Edward Evans in London at eevans3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-brexit-vision-takes-125948291.html,29/11/2019

Mahdi, who’s backed by neighboring power Iran, had offered to quit earlier but that time insisted he’d only go once lawmakers agreed on a replacement.On Friday, the prime minister said that once he resigns, parliament can “review its options and act to preserve the interests of Iraq.” The alternative could be a “vortex of violence, chaos and destruction,” he said.His move followed a call from an influential Shiite cleric for lawmakers to promptly hold “free and honest” elections to prevent the OPEC member from slipping into deeper chaos.Sheikh Ahmed Al-Safi, who speaks on behalf of Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, also renewed calls for officials to end the violent crackdown against protesters a day after security forces killed at least 25 people and wounded scores more in the southern city of Nassiriya, and demonstrators burned Iran’s consulate in holy city of Najaf.Iraq will “pay dearly” for any delay by parliament in holding elections that “express the people’s will,” Al-Safi said in a Friday sermon.At least 380 people have died in clashes between security forces and protesters since Oct. 1, Ali Al-Bayyati, a member of Iraq’s independent High Human Rights Commission, said in a text message.Violence Against Iraqi Protesters Is Rising, Rights Group SaysIraqis, mostly from the Shiite majority population, are protesting against government corruption, poor services, and wide-ranging Iranian political influence, calling for an overhaul of the ruling class.The turmoil in Iraq, along with sustained rallies that removed the prime minister of Lebanon, pose a particular challenge to Iran, which wants to protect the significant sway it holds over politics in both countries.Abdul-Mahdi, a former finance minister, was picked by rival Shiite Muslim groups as a consensus candidate following parliamentary elections in 2018, but has struggled to form a strong government and start the nation’s recovery from a devastating war with Islamic State jihadists.(Releads with PM announcing intent to resign.)To contact the reporters on this story: Khalid Al-Ansary in Baghdad at kalansary@bloomberg.net;Souhail Karam in Rabat at skaram10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams, Stuart BiggsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/iraq-cleric-calls-swift-election-113653881.html,29/11/2019

That’s due to its location at the heart of Europe and the fact Brussels is home to the European Union and NATO.Spying is the extreme end of Chinese interference in areas from academia to politics that’s aided by a relaxed attitude to the risks among Belgium’s establishment. The country’s broken political system — it still has no federal government six months after elections — gives regional politicians control over Chinese investments in areas including technology and logistics.The Belgian malaise contrasts with the EU’s more assertive attitude. New commission President Ursula von der Leyen has a clear and realistic view of Beijing, according to a senior EU diplomat who sees the tide turning toward a more united European stance on China.Germany will attempt to foster that unity next year when it hosts the first-ever summit of the EU’s 27 national leaders and President Xi Jinping. For Brussels, 2020 looks like it’s going to be a year of facing up to China’s risks as well as its rewards.Global HeadlinesThanksgiving surprise | Donald Trump made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan to meet with the country’s president and U.S. soldiers, saying that peace talks with the Taliban have resumed amid a push for a cease-fire with the militant group.

Sign up here. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government plans to tighten restrictions on foreign takeovers amid growing concerns China is scooping up Germany’s technology jewels.Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Friday proposed setting up a government committee that could take action in the case of an unwanted foreign bid. State-owned bank KfW, for example, could temporarily buy a stake in the target company to stop an unsolicited acquisition.Altmaier also proposed expanding reviews for investments by non-European Union companies that exceed a 10% stake in a company and pose a security risk. The rule, which so far applied only to defense and critical infrastructure, should also apply to areas of new technology, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology and robotics.&quot;Our economic model can only survive if we strengthen it,&quot; Altmaier told reporters in Berlin. &quot;We will in the future look more closely at planned investments in robotics and biotechnology.&quot;Altmaier’s proposals have yet to be vetted by Merkel and her cabinet. While Germany is trying to sidestep a trade conflict between the U.S. and China, its government is also under pressure to curtail Chinese inroads into Germany’s industrial heartland. That includes calls at home and abroad to restrict Chinese equipment supplier Huawei Technologies Co. from participating in the country’s planned 5G network.Germany has stepped up protectionist measures since the takeover of robot maker Kuka AG by China’s Midea Group Co. in 2016. That led Merkel’s government to rethink its tools for shielding technology companies and securing German competitiveness. Last year Merkel’s cabinet stopped a Chinese bid for the first time by vetoing the potential purchase of machine-tool manufacturer Leifeld Metal Spinning AG.To contact the reporter on this story: Birgit Jennen in Berlin at bjennen1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Raymond Colitt, Iain RogersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/germany-eyes-tough-rules-foreign-092810731.html,29/11/2019

The party has announced 10 new laws that would be ready to be implemented if co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley won an against-the-odds majority on Dec 12. Here is an at-a-glance look at what is in the 89-page manifesto. Environment The manifesto pledges a £100million-per-year investment plan to deliver a Green New Deal over the next 10 years. It would look to totally overhaul the use of fossil fuels by switching transport and industry to renewable energy sources, while upgrading household heating systems and planting 700 million trees within a decade. The party wants to use the measures to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2030. Brexit The pro-European Union party has re-committed itself to a second referendum and to campaign for Remain. It says staying in the bloc would help &quot;lead the fight against the climate emergency&quot;. General Election 2019 | Key questions, answered Crime Restorative justice would be expanded to allow those affected by crimes to meet offenders as part of a bid to cut the prison population by 50%. Misogyny would be made a hate crime under a Green-led administration and the personal use of drugs, including some Class A substances, would be de-criminalised. Heroin would be available on prescription and cannabis clubs would be permitted, allowing marijuana to be grown and consumed by adults. Welfare The Greens would introduce a universal basic income, providing every UK citizen with £89 per week in state funding. It would provide a boost to those in work and leave no-one on benefits worse off, according to the manifesto. Health Party leaders have promised to increase funding for the NHS by at least £6 billion each year until 2030 - a 4.5% increase on the 2018/19 budget. Privatisation in the NHS would also be abolished, while mental health care would be put on an &quot;equal footing&quot; with physical care. Education The party pledges to boost education funding by at least £4 billion per year and to lay down a long-term aim of reducing classes to 20 pupils and below. Ofsted would be replaced with a &quot;collaborative system of assessing&quot; schools and a new law would put onus on teaching children about climate change. In higher education, tuition fees would be scrapped and those who paid £9,000 a year to study would have their debt wiped.

22,33,U.S. to Negotiate Carbon Trades Under Climate Pact Shunned by Trump,"<p><a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/u-negotiate-carbon-trades-under-090000267.html""><img src="""" width=""130"" height=""86"" alt=""U.S. to Negotiate Carbon Trades Under Climate Pact Shunned by Trump"" align=""left"" title=""U.S. to Negotiate Carbon Trades Under Climate Pact Shunned by Trump"" border=""0"" ></a>(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump may be withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, but the U.S. is still going to be a force at the negotiating table as international leaders gather in Madrid next week to map out rules for carbon trading as a way to limit greenhouse gas emissions.Despite Trump’s rejection of the global agreement to cut carbon emissions, U.S. officials have long advocated emissions-trading schemes on the world stage and the government wants a say in the structure of those carbon markets -- a key issue before delegates at the annual United Nations climate summit that begins Monday.The transparency and accountability of such markets is a top priority for the U.S. government and businesses such as airlines and oil companies that may have to offset their own emissions through carbon trading.“Even though one might not care about climate, you don’t want countries to be able to cheat,” said Brad Schallert, deputy director of international climate coordination for the World Wildlife Fund, which supports global action to thwart climate change. “That is something in the long-term interest of the U.S.”The U.S. government is dispatching a small team of career diplomats and officials to the climate talks, largely mirroring the delegation that attended last year’s summit in Poland. They will also be joined by representatives of some businesses and state and local governments.But unlike the past two years, where the Trump administration played a contrarian role and held discussions to promote clean coal, the U.S. is not planning a similar side event in Madrid. And, in another shift, political appointees from the Trump administration also won’t be attending, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement.The U.S. team is set to be led by two career officials from the State Department: climate negotiator Kim Carnahan and Marcia Bernicat, a principal deputy assistant secretary, the people said.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo emphasized earlier this month that the U.S. will “continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model” and highlight the role of innovation and open markets during international climate discussions.While Trump has begun exiting the Paris pact, that withdrawal won’t be official until Nov. 4, 2020 -- the day after the next U.S. presidential election. Other countries still welcome U.S. negotiators in the talks, according to longtime climate summit-goers, because the diplomats bring expertise to the discussions and their participation could help forge rules that would be palatable to the U.S. should a future president seek to change course. Democratic presidential contenders have widely vowed to rejoin the pact.Oil and gas companies that unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to remain in the Paris agreement have a vested interest in the negotiations, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “They are supportive of emissions trading and other mechanisms because in the event there ever is a domestic binding climate regime in the United States, that would give them flexibility to reduce the costs on their own facilities of compliance,” he said.Official negotiations will focus on one of the thorniest aspects of the 2015 Paris agreement: how to use markets to help slash greenhouse gas emissions. In Article 6 of the 2015 pact, countries agreed to create a new system for trading allowances covering greenhouse gases, but negotiators are still haggling over the details.New carbon markets could allow countries to sell emissions credits generated from programs that curb greenhouse gases, such as upgrading the efficiency of industrial plants, paring pollution from air conditioning systems, developing renewable power installations and planting trees.About half of countries in the Paris agreement are counting on such emissions trading to help fulfill their carbon-cutting promises. But environmentalists want to make sure the system isn’t undermined by loopholes and double counting.Many environmental advocacy groups also want to limit credits to projects that wouldn’t have happened otherwise -- responding to a major criticism of an earlier carbon-trading regime that came out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. They are fighting a push by Brazil to allow unused credits from the older system to be grandfathered in to the new approach.“The U.S. has been fairly helpful on Article 6, in terms of pushing for robust accounting standards and safeguards against double counting and raising skepticism about the proposal from Brazil,” said Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If we get it right, it can facilitate higher ambition and get us closer to being on track for the Paris temperature goals. If we get it wrong, it can really blow a hole in the integrity of the Paris commitments, and that would be a disaster.”The U.S. government’s active role negotiating international carbon market rules is tethered to a related effort to curb emissions from airlines, said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Even though Trump is withdrawing from the Paris agreement, the U.S. remains part of the International Civil Aviation Organization and supports its plan to offset plane pollution by planting trees, investing in clean energy and taking other steps to curb emissions.The aviation program “is somewhat predicated on the Paris agreement accounting system to guard against double counting reduction units, so the U.S. has an interest in seeing that system put in place,” Diringer said.Continued U.S. involvement at climate talks also reflects the country’s longstanding connection to United Nations action on the issue. The U.S. will retain a seat at the Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the underlying 1992 environmental treaty.The official U.S. delegation will be buttressed by scores of other Americans representing local governments, corporations and advocacy groups arguing that the U.S. is still committed to fighting climate change and meeting its Paris agreement pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. Panel discussions and other events also are planned to highlight ways businesses and local governments are curbing emissions.Representatives from oil companies Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc and electric utilities PNM Resources and DTE Energy are set to attend alongside the lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, the mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and other elected officials.Some of the U.S. activities planned in Madrid are supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.“Despite what our federal government’s position is on the Paris agreement and climate change more broadly, there’s quite a bit of action going on that is making an impact,” said Elan Strait, director of U.S. climate campaigns for the World Wildlife Fund. “If these actors work together and scale up what they are doing, the U.S. target under Paris is actually within striking distance, and that’s the message they can take to the climate talks.”To contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer A.

The alleged mismarking, involving placing a value on securities which doesn’t reflect their actual worth, is being investigated by the bank and is said to involve emerging-market currencies. It&#39;s another black eye for American banks this week following Citigroup Inc. being slapped with a fine from U.K. regulators for reporting failures.Shifting OddsU.K. consumer confidence will head into the election at the lowest level prior to a poll since 2010, which took place in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The odds are now tilting further in the direction of the Conservatives following this week’s closely-watched YouGov poll pointing to a big majority for the Tories. Some more data emerged this week that may catch the eye, showing net migration to the U.K. from the European Union has fallen to the lowest level since 2003. But even if the odds are in Boris Johnson’s favor, traders are staying cautious and keeping hedges in place just in case there’s another big surprise.Surprise VisitPresident Donald Trump made a surprise trip to visit troops in Afghanistan for Thanksgiving to announce talks with the Taliban aimed at securing a cease-fire. He met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, discussed reducing troop numbers and made a speech that touched variously on stock-market highs and hero military dogs. All in all, a new foreign policy push from the president to add to the radar. On another front, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles on Thursday and may be planning bigger moves, so his plate will be full.Disgruntled PartnerIt will be an important weekend for German politics as the campaign to lead the Social Demcrats, the disgruntled coalition partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s Christian Democrats, comes to a close. The results will arrive on Saturday, but if the vote goes the way of the faction that wants out of the coalition, it would threaten the state of the current government and create political turmoil the country could live without as its economy suffers in the shadow of the trade war.Coming Up…Asian stocks slipped on the final trading day of the month with Hong Kong absorbing the heaviest hit. European stock futures also point to an open in the red. It is relatively quiet on the earnings front but there is plenty of European data to watch for, including GDP for France and Italy, inflation in the euro area and German unemployment. And, it’s Black Friday, potentially a make-or-break time for many struggling retailers and sure to produce plenty of memes of shoppers battling for bargains as the day progresses.What We’ve Been ReadingThis is what’s caught our eye over the past 24 hours. Financial warnings signs for China are flashing everywhere.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.Ursula von der Leyen has big plans for the Brussels bubble. She wants her new-look European Commission to be less inward-looking and provincial, shifting its focus to geopolitics and a zero-carbon future. But any ambitious proposals face an uphill battle at the fractious EU Parliament, not to mention the perennial challenge of winning approval from the bloc’s governments. Ahead of Sunday’s change of guard at the EU executive, here’s what von der Leyen plans and why it won’t be easy.What’s HappeningGoing Up | The first pickup in euro-area inflation in five months is on its way, with data due today expected to show price growth accelerated in November. But it’s largely driven by fuel, and underlying price pressures are still subdued. That shows the challenge for Christine Lagarde, who’s hinted that one of her first moves could be a review of why the ECB has fallen far short of its inflation goal for years.Judgment Day | In a vote that could decide the future of Germany’s ruling coalition, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will find out tomorrow if members of his Social Democratic Party have elected him co-leader. Scholz’s main challenger, Norbert Walter-Borjans, has hinted he may pull the SPD out of government, triggering a fresh bout of political turbulence in Europe’s biggest economy.Week Ahead | A key piece of the euro’s missing architecture could move a step closer next week, if the bloc’s finance chiefs manage to make some progress on the highly contentious issue of common deposit insurance. While technical talks have so far only confirmed entrenched differences, officials hope the discussion could yield a long-sought compromise.Aviation Tax | EU finance ministers are also set to endorse a revamp of energy-taxation laws that could end exemptions for jet fuel while promoting cleaner forms of energy, according to a draft communique. The move would come as the bloc steps up efforts to reduce transport emissions, one of its biggest challenges as it weighs a commitment to climate neutrality by 2050.Gold Rush | Gold is the new obsession for nationalist leaders in Europe’s east these days. Demand for the precious yellow metal mirrors steps by Russia and China to diversify reserves exceeding $3 trillion away from the dollar amid flaring geopolitical tensions with the U.S.Apologies | Due to a technical glitch, yesterday’s newsletter failed to reach your inboxes. If you want to catch up and read about the EU’s outgoing trade champion you can find it here.In Case You Missed ItData Probe | A year ago, the European Parliament slammed Facebook Inc. over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Now it’s embroiled in a privacy scandal of its own after using U.S. software company NationBuilder to process data about more than 300,000 people.Climate Spending | European heavy industries will need massive investment if the continent is to reach a goal of being carbon neutral in three decades. That’s according to a report by a high-level EU advisory group, which warned that the bloc’s industry can’t be competitive against foreign rivals unless it takes measures and spends on new technologies.NATO Review | Emmanuel Macron urged NATO leaders to review the alliance’s strategy when they meet in London next week and said it should focus on the threat from terrorism rather than Russia. His comments come after he alarmed European allies by declaring he wants improved relations with Vladimir Putin despite Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.Spies ’n Fries | Belgium may seem an unlikely destination for a Chinese agent. In fact, it’s a den of spies. Host to EU institutions and NATO, Brussels is an alluring draw card for aspiring espionage-makers.Spanish Slack | The reforms Spain enacted seven years and four governments ago still get cited admiringly by officials in Frankfurt and Brussels as a good example. But political stasis in the euro zone’s fourth-biggest economy increasingly threatens to leave one of the region’s most dysfunctional labor markets to fester.Chart of the DayGermany and Austria topped a ranking of financial wellbeing in Europe, with Greece and Lithuania taking the bottom spots. Swedish debt collector Intrum AB surveyed consumers on their ability to pay bills on time, freedom from credit, savings and financial literacy to launch its new Financial Wellbeing Barometer that ranks 24 European countries.Today’s AgendaAll times CET.11 a.m. Handover between outgoing EU Council President Tusk and incoming President Michel11 a.m. Eurostat publishes flash estimate for euro-area November inflation and October unemployment12 p.m. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg gives news conference ahead of alliance meeting12:30 Last midday briefing of the current Commission with outgoing President JunckerEU antitrust chief Vestager in Copenhagen, delivers speech at Danish Competition AuthorityLike the Brussels Edition?Don’t keep it to yourself.

Despite the tranquil surroundings, those close to Johnson fear the gathering at the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire could turn into a train wreck that hurts his bid for power.The potential catalyst for their nightmare scenario? Johnson’s close ally, Donald Trump.Ahead of the Dec. 12 election, the U.S. president may yet become the most dangerous weapon in the armory of British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party aims to oust Johnson’s Conservatives. Corbyn’s argument is simple: Johnson and Trump are right-wing soul mates who collectively pose an unprecedented threat to the U.K.’s cherished National Health Service.If Johnson wins a majority in parliament and completes the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, he will rush towards a free trade deal with the U.S. in which the NHS will be up for sale, Corbyn says. That, he claims, will lead to higher prices for drugs and ruin forever the free-to-use healthcare that Britons have come to expect.Despite denials from the Conservatives that the NHS would be on the chopping block, it’s a potent narrative with voters—one that has troubled Johnson’s senior team since long before the election campaign started. And now Trump will materialize on British soil just 10 days before the election.Trump lands in London on Monday. He’ll be greeted by the usual anti-Trump protesters, and Corbyn is certain to make the most of any pictures of Trump and Johnson standing shoulder to shoulder.Privately, though, what senior Tories worry about the most is that Trump will go off script. One senior official confided that this was the biggest risk facing the election operation. The president can’t be trusted to stop himself weighing in with ill-judged comments, the official said.A cabinet minister endorsed those concerns. Another senior official said measures were being taken to minimize the risk, though they didn’t say how this would be possible given Trump’s penchant for speaking his mind at all hours on Twitter, or for going off topic when he holds media briefings.And there are good reasons for the Conservatives to be anxious.On his previous visit to London in June, Trump gifted Corbyn an attack line by suggesting at a briefing with Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May that access to the NHS for U.S. companies would be one of the things “on the table” in trade talks after Brexit.Following the inevitable outcry, Trump issued a clarification, saying the NHS was not something he’d be seeking to exploit. But the damage had been done.Labour received another boost on Oct. 31 when Trump gave a surprise interview to his friend Nigel Farage, the veteran far-right politician who leads the Brexit Party. He ditched the convention of political neutrality in a foreign election to warmly endorse the “fantastic” Johnson, while warning Corbyn would be “so bad” for the U.K.During the interview, Trump urged Johnson and Farage to join forces to defeat Corbyn and complete Brexit. He also tried to make amends for his earlier comments by saying he did not want the NHS to be on the table for a future trade deal.“I think Trump actually pole axed Corbyn,” Farage said in an interview this month. “Corbyn says the NHS will be sold to the Americans, Trump says it’s not even on the table.”Yet Tory advisers were aghast. By mentioning the NHS again, even in a denial, the president ensured it stayed prominent in the public consciousness.And while Farage is a fan, there is some evidence that Britons increasingly are not. Most people questioned by YouGov earlier this year saw a trade deal with the U.S. as worthwhile, but a separate survey found that fewer thought the government should try to work with Trump than did so when he first became president.According to YouGov polling conducted since the start of the election campaign, the NHS is the single most important domestic policy priority for voters. While Brexit is the top issue for the country, healthcare is second. It is a measure of the sanctity of the NHS that more than half of ordinary taxpayers (53%) would be willing to pay more to fund investment in it. Fewer than a third (31%) of people opposed higher taxes to do so, the research showed.Founded 71 years ago, the $200 billion a year NHS has become a rallying point among Labour supporters and left-wing politicians. Corbyn regularly addresses rallies of healthcare workers. Doctors and nurses have urged people to vote against the Conservatives to protect the NHS from privatization or funding cuts.Since Johnson became prime minister in July, he has been on a mission to recover lost ground on the NHS. Barely a week has passed without a visit to a hospital, sleeves rolled up and tie tucked for hygiene purposes into his shirt. But senior Conservatives are concerned he remains vulnerable to Labour’s attacks.One cabinet minister said that even in a safe Tory seat Johnson is not wholly trusted, with voters likely to question his claims to be spending billions on building new hospitals. Another warned that whatever the truth of Labour’s arguments, voters are listening to what Corbyn is saying.The minister was furious at publicity given to Corbyn’s claim this week to have unearthed a document purportedly showing a secret government plan to sell the NHS, when Tories say the paper proved nothing.According to the minister, the Conservatives’ internal polling shows voters don’t buy Corbyn’s argument the NHS would be for sale if Johnson struck a trade deal with Trump. But the Labour leader’s point has still cut through. Voters know the NHS debate is not finished.If, as expected, Corbyn tries to use the NATO summit to attack Johnson for his links to Trump, Tories plan to retaliate: By stressing the Labour leader’s weakness on national security (he’s a lifelong anti-war campaigner) and his reluctance to support NATO.The Tories are taking other measures, too. When Trump arrives at the country estate, don’t expect him to be welcomed with fanfare or a public hug from Johnson. A joint press conference is not on the agenda for now. This is one presidential visit that will be kept as low key as Johnson’s nervous aides can manage.To contact the author of this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at rmathieson3@bloomberg.net, Flavia Krause-JacksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/tories-secretly-fear-donald-trump-050000691.html,29/11/2019

Then she will have to find tools to mobilize trillions of euros to finance the transition, which will affect everything from energy production to transport and farming.Post-Brexit TalksObjective: Get a comprehensive and balanced agreement to cement the EU’s relationship with the U.K. after Brexit.Challenge: Securing a deal that’s beneficial to the EU over the long term, particularly in the areas of trade and security, while not giving the U.K. everything it wants. It’ll be crucial to keep the 27 governments united, a task that will become even trickier when their competing priorities are laid bare.Dealing With TrumpObjective: Navigate an increasingly hostile transatlantic relationship.Challenge: The U.S. is the bloc’s most important ally, and relations between the two regions have deteriorated dramatically since Donald Trump took office three years ago.The president has called the EU a “foe” that’s “almost as bad as China, just smaller.” He has also threatened to hit the bloc with tariffs on its auto exports, which would ignite a new front in the global trade war.In addition to the trade conflict, the U.S. plans to leave the Paris climate accord next year, while Trump has hectored European allies over their defense spending and even flirted with the idea of leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization all together.Global TradeObjective: Preserve the World Trade Organization system.Challenge: Meeting U.S. demands for a WTO revamp while countering American and Chinese practices that are undermining the organization. With the WTO threatened by U.S. protectionism, a looming appellate-body deadlock as a result of Washington’s refusal to consider new appointments and communist China’s trade distortions, the task is as urgent as it is formidable.Objective: Expand the EU’s trade-policy arsenal, possibly by empowering the bloc to sanction countries (read the U.S. under Trump) that both impose illegal commercial barriers and block the WTO’s dispute-settlement process.Challenge: Persuade EU capitals that such an initiative wouldn’t ultimately hurt their bilateral ties with big trade partners outside the bloc. While trade is among the most centralized EU policies, member nations can be reluctant to expand the bloc’s powers in this area because doing so could mean even less national control.Economic PolicyObjective: Complete the European Monetary Union.Challenge: There’s not too much von der Leyen’s team can do at the moment to complete the euro’s architecture, because the next steps mainly lie in the hands of euro-area nations. And they seem to be making some progress on common deposit insurance, something the commission has urged for repeatedly. However, it’s unlikely they’ll agree on anything like what Brussels originally had in mind.Meanwhile, other initiatives she is keen to push, such as a European unemployment reinsurancescheme, have received a lukewarm response from the bloc’s governments.Financial RegulationObjective: Fix Europe’s fragmented banking and capital markets.Challenge: These two projects have remained unfinished as national governments repeatedly held up steps to strike down barriers that banks and other financial firms face in the EU’s common market. The so-called banking union has pitted fiscally conservative countries like Germany against the more highly indebted ones in southern Europe, meaning a difficult compromise will have to be brokered.As for Europe’s capital markets -- which are severely underdeveloped compared with to the U.S. -- the task is to stop tinkering around the edges and undertake meaningful reforms in sensitive areas like insolvency laws and taxes.Data ProtectionObjective: Turn straw into gold -- or unused data into “innovation” -- with a framework to encourage governments and companies to pool data that they can squeeze insights from.Challenge: Von der Leyen wants to go further than even the EU’s tough new data-protection clauses, which give regulators the powers for the first time to fine companies as much as 4% of global annual sales for serious data violations.Data rules in Europe are already a minefield, with some companies struggling to apply a complicated new regulation on personal data. Thierry Breton, the EU’s incoming data commissioner, will be tasked with creating some safe spaces to share non-personal information, skirting antitrust rules that don’t allow rivals to swap some sensitive data. It’s unclear whether there’s gold in Europe’s data hills and if a new legal framework will really unlock vast economic value.Artificial IntelligenceObjective: Unveil AI legislation within 100 days of taking office.Challenge: The commission still needs to figure out precisely what problems it wants to address with any new rules, which could hit a wide range of industries. One hundred days is an especially ambitious timeline to unveil a legislative proposal, especially if the EU wants to launch a so-called impact assessment -- which would allow outside experts and companies to provide feedback on potential policies.That may be why von der Leyen didn’t stress the timeline in her confirmation speech at the European Parliament on Wednesday.EU EnlargementObjective: Von der Leyen wants the EU to keep its door open to further expansion.Challenge: Emmanuel Macron has blocked the start of accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia and is seeking a reform of the entire enlargement process before any such talks can begin. But France’s proposals are seen by many as too vague to form a basis for the commission to kick-start an overhaul of the process and little more than an excuse to stop accession talks all together.&#92;--With assistance from Nikos Chrysoloras, Stephanie Bodoni, Alexander Weber, Viktoria Dendrinou, Ian Wishart, Natalia Drozdiak, Ewa Krukowska and Aoife White.To contact the reporters on this story: Nikos Chrysoloras in Brussels at nchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;Jonathan Stearns in Brussels at jstearns2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, Andrew Blackman, Richard BravoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/wrong-europe-chief-plans-fix-040000636.html,29/11/2019

34,45,Tories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate Debate,"<p><a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/tories-riled-iceblock-replaces-u-014427649.html""><img src="""" width=""130"" height=""86"" alt=""Tories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate Debate"" align=""left"" title=""Tories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate Debate"" border=""0"" ></a>(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. Conservative Party accused Channel 4 News of breaking impartiality rules after the broadcaster used a melting ice sculpture of a globe to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson who failed to attend a live climate change debate on Thursday night.The news program had asked the leaders of the key political parties to take part in the debate ahead of the Dec. 12 election but Johnson and Brexit Party head Nigel Farage chose not to attend. This prompted Channel 4 to replace the two politicians with ice sculptures rather than the empty chairs as is usually the case.The decision by Johnson, who is expected to lead the Conservatives into a comfortable majority, drew derision on social media. Hashtags such as WheresBoris and borisisacoward trended in the U.K. as online users vented frustration with Johnson’s choice to refrain from debating on a topic that is seen to be one of the greatest issues for generations to come.The Conservatives complained to broadcast regulator Ofcom, calling the news program’s action “a provocative partisan stunt” which had the potential to be seen as a political opinion in its own right. Unlike in the U.S., television broadcasters in Britain face strict rules on being politically impartial during election periods and can face fines if they do not comply.The party’s director of communications Lee Cain, who wrote the complaint, said Channel 4 News prevented senior Cabinet Minister Michael Gove from representing Johnson. Gove, who showed up without invitation for the debate, accused Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of blocking his attempt to join them in a separate tweet.Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear shot back, saying the channel had made it clear that the debate could only involve party leaders. He later told the Guardian that the two ice sculptures represented the emergency on planet Earth and were a visual metaphor for the Conservative and Brexit parties who declined the broadcaster’s invitations for the debate.Michael Gove @michaelgoveTonight I went to Channel 4 to talk about climate change but Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon refused to debate a Conservative climatedebatehttp://twitter.com/michaelgove/statuses/1200166068741902337Sent via Twitter for iPhone.View original tweet.Broadcasters have faced an uphill task to convince Johnson to take part in interviews and debates.

Sign up here. China is making a habit of issuing vague retaliation threats. So far, however, it hasn’t actually done much.The foreign ministry gave another warning on Thursday after President Donald Trump signed bills backing Hong Kong’s protesters, using language that mirrored a statement last week.China issued similar threats earlier this year after the U.S. approved arms sales to Taiwan, sanctioned companies over human-rights abuses in Xinjiang and put Huawei Technologies Co. on a blacklist.“We suggest that the U.S. stops sticking obstinately to its course or China will take resolute countermeasures,” the foreign ministry said. “The U.S. side will bear all responsibility for the consequences.”Later, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dodged questions on when China would reply or whether it would impact trade talks, telling reporters to “stay tuned.”“What will come will come,” he said.The failure to flesh out the details despite having weeks to prepare shows the difficulties China faces in hitting the U.S. without also hurting its own economy, which is growing at the slowest pace in almost three decades. Apart from implementing retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., China has largely stuck to a policy of “strategic composure” when it comes to other aspects of the relationship.Trade Talks ImpactMei Xinyu, a researcher at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry, said that the Hong Kong issue will definitely be discussed at the trade negotiation table and China will likely ask the U.S. side to clarify its stance, or even make some promises on refraining from using the bill.He added that China will prepare some countermeasures at the same time, echoing the Foreign Ministry’s remarks earlier, without elaborating on what specific measures will be taken.“It’ll bring a certain degree of uncertainty to the ongoing trade talks,” Mei said. “But it won’t necessarily make or break a deal.”While slowing down the trade talks is the most obvious way China could retaliate, it’s clear that until now Beijing has tolerated a lot just to keep them on track. Without a phase one deal, China faces the prospect of another tariff hike in mid-December.There are other options, though most of them also carry the risk of backfiring economically.That’s something President Xi Jinping may not want to risk with economic troubles mounting at home and the Hong Kong unrest showing no signs of abating.Unreliable EntitiesIt could hit out at U.S. companies by releasing a long-threatened “unreliable entities” list, stop buying American products, unload Treasuries or curb exports to the U.S. of rare earths, which are critical to everything from smart-phones to electronic vehicles.On the diplomatic side, China could take measures such as halting cooperation on enforcing sanctions related to North Korea and Iran, recalling the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. or downgrading diplomatic relations.Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of state-run Global Times, said in a tweet Thursday that China was considering putting the drafters of the law on a no-entry list.“Hong Kong has increasingly become a card in China-U.S. trade war,” E Zhihuan, chief economist at Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd, said at a briefing in Beijing. “Now that Trump has showed his card, how we should react tests our wisdom. It’s a very complex and difficult situation.”Trump himself had little choice but to sign the bills, which required sanctions against any officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses or undermining the city’s autonomy, as well as banning the export of crowd-control items such as tear gas and rubber bullets to the city’s police. Near-unanimous support in Congress meant lawmakers could override a veto, and Trump doesn’t want to give Democrats an opening for attack ahead of the 2020 election.In signing the bills, Trump signaled to Xi that action wouldn’t be imminent. He expressed concerns with unspecified portions of the new law, saying they risked interfering with his constitutional authority to carry out American foreign policy.“I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong,” the president said in a statement Wednesday.Internal AffairsFor China, however, the bills represent an interference in their internal affairs and could even encourage protesters who have become increasingly violent in recent months. While the trade talks are separate, the overall relationship could suffer, according to He Weiwen, who previously served as a commercial attache at the Chinese consulates in New York and San Francisco.“The U.S. has damaged China’s sovereignty and China will of course retaliate,” said He, who is now a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. “Sovereignty prevails over trade for China.”When asked what China is likely to do, however, He didn’t elaborate.“I don’t know what specific moves they will make,” he said. “But there will likely be some consequences.”&#92;--With assistance from Yinan Zhao and Carolynn Look.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Peter Martin in Beijing at pmartin138@bloomberg.net;Lin Zhu in Beijing at lzhu243@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Ten Kate at dtenkate@bloomberg.net, Jeffrey Black, James MaygerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/big-hong-kong-china-hit-093854739.html,29/11/2019

South Korea’s Defense Ministry provided similar data on the flights and called the launches “regrettable.”There may be more to come with the brisk movement of vehicles detected this month near an ICBM launch site, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified South Korean official. The movement appears to be associated with an engine test and South Korea is keeping a close eye on the situation, it said.The latest test came two years to the date since leader Kim Jong Un’s regime last test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting all of the U.S. Kim put a brief freeze on testing after that and then resumed firing with a vengeance from May, sending off about two dozen missiles -- almost all of them short-range ballistic missiles.“Kim considers Trump as his political hostage and sees himself in a position to dictate the terms of the deal by demonstrating his capability to influence Trump’s chance for re-election,” said Chun Yungwoo, South Korea’s former chief envoy to international nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea.Kim Jong Un Bolsters Nuclear Threat to U.S. as Trump Talks StallNorth Korea released photos of the Thursday test. Kim, who has been on hand for many of the operations this year, attended the launch and “expressed great satisfaction over the results of the test-fire,” the country’s official Korean Central News Agency reported Friday.The missiles tested appear to be North Korea’s KN-25, a solid-fuel rocket designed to fired off in rapid succession from a mobile launcher that typically holds about four tubes. A series of shorter-range missile launches in recent months has improved North Korea’s ability to make solid-fuel ballistic missiles that are easier to move, hide and fire than many of its liquid-fuel versions.“These tests help improve their solid-fuel motors and not only is it good for their short-range systems, it would likely make their long-range missiles quicker and more powerful,” said Melissa Hanham, a weapons expert and deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.Kim’s testing freeze ushered in unprecedented diplomacy with Trump, leading to historic meetings in Singapore, Vietnam and the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. But Kim and Trump have little to show for their negotiations, with the U.S. and North Korea unable to agree on what they mean by denuclearization.Since the talks have started, Kim has been busy churning out fissile material for bombs and developing new missile technology that could make the next big launch of an ICBM even more concerning to Pentagon military planners, weapons experts have said.Trump has brushed off North Korea’s missile tests, which Japan and others say violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, signaling to Kim that he can continue developing his weapons program as long as he doesn’t fire off another ICBM.Kim has given Trump until the end of the year to ease up on sanctions choking his state’s paltry economy. In recent weeks his top cadres have been quoted in official media as expressing frustration by what they saw as U.S. inflexibility. The Trump team has said North Korea can only get rewards when it completely gives up nuclear arms -- a move Pyongyang has said would be tantamount to political suicide.“We, without being given anything, gave things the U.S. president can brag about but the U.S. side has not yet taken any corresponding step,” a spokesman for the State Affairs Commission headed by Kim said earlier this month. He added that the U.S. will face a “greater threat” if it does nothing.&#92;--With assistance from Shinhye Kang and Sophie Jackman.To contact the reporters on this story: Jon Herskovitz in Tokyo at jherskovitz@bloomberg.net;Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Ten Kate at dtenkate@bloomberg.net, Jon Herskovitz, Muneeza NaqviFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-appears-fired-missile-081315782.html,29/11/2019

Photograph: Evan Frost/APA campaign account for Danielle Stella, a pro-Trump Republican candidate for Congress, was banned from Twitter after it published a violent comment about the Democrat she hopes to unseat next year, Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar.Stella’s campaign Twitter account, @2020MNCongress, featured at least two posts involving the idea of Omar being hanged, according to the Washington Times, which broke the story of her suspension.embedThe tweets concerned an unsubstantiated allegation that Omar – one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress – shared sensitive information with Qatar, which then wound up with Iran.A spokesperson for Omar previously told the Jerusalem Post of the claim: “Since the day she was elected, Saudi Arabian trolls and mouthpieces have targeted Omar with misinformation and conspiracy theories.”An initial tweet from Stella’s campaign account reportedly said: “If it is proven [Omar] passed sensitive info to Iran, she should be tried for treason and hanged.”The Washington Times said the account “subsequently tweeted the link to an article that aggregated her remark, accompanied by a crude depiction of a stick figure hanging from gallows”.The @2020MNCongress account cannot be viewed. Text on the page reads “account suspended” and “Twitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules”.In a statement, Twitter told the Guardian: “The account was permanently suspended for repeated violations of the Twitter Rules.”Stella said in a statement: “My suspension for advocating for the enforcement of federal code proves Twitter will always side with and fight to protect terrorists, traitors, pedophiles and rapists.”The Guardian revealed that Stella has been arrested twice this year over accusations that she shoplifted some $2,300 in goods from Target and $40 in items from a grocery, Stella has maintained her innocence.She has made claims about Omar before, claiming she broke the law by telling immigrants how to avoid authorities. Lawmakers who don’t “uphold the rule of law”, Stella said, should be kicked out of office.A spokesperson for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Since winning election to Congress last year, Omar has attracted rightwing attacks and fringe conspiracy theories as well as outright threats of violence. The congresswoman said this April she faced an increase in death threats after Trump accused her of downplaying September 11.On 19 November, New York man Patrick Carlineo pleaded guilty in relation to calling Omar’s office and telling a staffer: “Why are you working for her, she’s a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive].”Omar, who came to the US as a Somali refugee, appealed for “compassion”.“As someone who fled a war zone, I know how destabilizing acts of political violence can be,” she said in a letter to the judge. “That his threat of violence relied on hateful stereotypes about my faith only made it more dangerous … it was a threat against an entire religion, at a time of rising hate crime against religious minorities in our country.”She added: “We must ask: who are we as a nation if we respond to acts of political retribution with retribution ourselves? The answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion.”<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/ilhan-omars-republican-opponent-banned-203356198.html,28/11/2019

A margin that size would allow him to ratify his Brexit deal ahead of the Jan. 31 deadline, and potentially give him some breathing space to compromise in subsequent trade negotiations with the European Union.The Prime Minister, who refused to attend a TV debate on climate change with other party leaders on Thursday evening, said he would walk away from a U.S. trade deal after Brexit if President Donald Trump insists on keeping the National Health Service on the table.Must Read: U.K. Election: The Key Party PromisesFor more on the election visit ELEC.Key Developments:YouGov: Conservatives on course for 43% (359 seats), Labour 32% (211 seats), Liberal Democrats 14% (13 seats), SNP 3% (43 seats), Brexit Party 3% (0 seats)Pound rises as much as 0.2% in London before paring gainsJohnson tells ITV the election is still “a very tight race” and there’s a risk of a hung ParliamentThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said neither Conservatives nor Labour have credible spending plansLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders debated climate change in a TV debate. Johnson didn’t show up and hosts Channel 4 turned away Michael Gove, who had been sent as a substitute.Still ‘a Very Tight Race,’ Johnson Says (8 p.m.)Boris Johnson insisted in an interview with ITV that the election is still “a very tight race” in spite of polls showing his Conservatives winning a comfortable majority.“There is a genuine risk that there could be a Corbyn, Sturgeon coalition,” he said.Johnson: No U.S. Deal if NHS Included (7:15 p.m.)Boris Johnson insisted the National Health Service will not be on the table in trade talks with the U.S. after Brexit and said he would walk away if President Donald Trump insists on keeping it in the negotiations.“Goodbye, we’d say see you then, that would be it,” Johnson said when asked how he would respond if Trump insists on discussing U.S. access to the state funded health system. “There’s be no point in continuing the conversation.”Labour said on Wednesday that Johnson’s Tories have been involved in secret talks with the U.S. and produced documents which they said showed the two sides have already discussed access for U.S. corporations and pharmaceutical companies to the service.“The NHS is one of the greatest things about British society, it’s loved and admired around the world. Why would you do something as stupid as that,” Johnson said in an interview with ITV.Read More: Corbyn Accuses U.K. Tories of Secret NHS Talks With the U.S.Labour Donations Beat Tories in 2nd Week (3 p.m.)Donations to the Labour Party topped those to the Conservatives in the second week of the election campaign. In the week of Nov. 13-19, Labour reaped 3.49 million pounds ($4.5 million), compared to 2.97 million pounds for the Conservatives, according to a statement from the Electoral Commission. The Brexit Party was given 2.25 million pounds and the Liberal Democrats 251,000 pounds, the commission said.The Electoral Commission release, which only details donations of more than 7,500 pounds, includes a 2 million-pound gift for the Brexit Party from Christopher Harborne, a businessman. Most of Labour’s total in the official data came from Unite, the labor union, which donated 3 million pounds, but the party said Wednesday it had also been given more than 2.5 million pounds in small donations in the month since the election was called -- 98% of it in amounts of 100 pounds or less.It’s a turnaround from the first week of the campaign, when the Tory total of 5.7 million pounds eclipsed Labour’s 218,500 pounds and the Liberal Democrats’ 275,000 pounds.Liberal Democrats Step Up Attack on Johnson (12 p.m.)Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson is driven by a “sense of Etonian entitlement” rather than any “burning desire to make people’s lives better,” as she seeks to position her party as the only one that can take seats off the Conservatives.In a speech titled “The Problem with Boris Johnson,” Swinson said most people are in politics “for the right reasons” and suggested the prime minister doesn’t care about ordinary people. “Boris Johnson only cares about Boris Johnson and he will do whatever it takes, sacrifice whatever or whoever is needed to get what he wants,” Swinson said.The problem for Swinson is that polls show her message is not cutting through with voters. According to the latest YouGov projection, the Liberal Democrats are on course to gain just one extra seat in the Dec. 12 vote.Javid Says He’s ‘Confident’ on Policy Costings (12 p.m.)Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said he’s “confident” about the costings and funding for the Conservative Party’s manifesto pledges, after the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank accused both Labour and the Tories (see 10 a.m.) of lacking credibility on their spending plans.“We have been very clear with our spending commitments in this election,” Javid told reporters during a campaign visit to Darlington, according to the Press Association. “We have a very detailed costings document -- the most detailed I would say that any party has published in any British election -- so I’m very confident about that.”Javid also attacked Labour’s plans, saying they would trigger a loss of confidence in the U.K. economy.IFS Says Tory, Labour Spending Plans Not Credible (10 a.m.)The Institute for Fiscal Studies offered a damning analysis of both the Conservatives’ and Labour’s election pledges, and warned voters to expect higher taxes than either party has outlined.Boris Johnson’s Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour have outlined vastly different offerings for voters. While Corbyn is promising a generational shift in public spending along with sweeping nationalization plans, the ruling party is presenting a more fiscally conservative approach, offering themselves up as the responsible alternative to Labour’s radical ideas.But according to the IFS, neither party has a “properly credible prospectus.” In its assessment, the Tories will end up spending more than planned, and so will have to raise taxes or borrow more, and Labour won’t be able to deliver on the investment plans on the scale it imagines. In the longer term, Labour would also need to raise more funding, and the IFS says it would have to hike income taxes on more than just the top 5% of earners.Read more: Think Tank Criticizes Fiscal Plans of Both Major PartiesLabour’s ‘Red Wall’ Problem (9:30 a.m.)Wednesday night’s YouGov poll showed Labour winning no new seats and watching the crumbling of its so-called red wall of districts in the north of England -- examples include Bishop Auckland, Great Grimsby and Bolsover -- which are traditionally Labour, but also strongly in favor of Brexit and now forecast to fall to the Tories.So far, Corbyn’s party has focused on trying to ensure it doesn’t lose votes to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, and its policy to hold a second referendum on Brexit reflects that. But the YouGov poll shows Labour must now find a way to win support back from the Tories among voters committed to leaving the bloc. It’s likely that the party will shift its message in the coming days.But there’s plenty of uncertainty in the YouGov forecast. Of the predicted Conservative gains, 30 were by less than 5%. And the poll itself could change behavior. By offering a seat-by-seat prediction, it could enable voters who oppose Brexit or the Conservatives to see how best to vote against Johnson.Read more: Key Poll Predicts Big Majority for Johnson to Deliver BrexitHancock: Patents, Drugs Off Table in U.S. Talks (Earlier)Health Secretary Matt Hancock used his broadcast round to hit back at Labour’s accusations (see Labour’s Gardiner earlier) that a Conservative government would allow the National Health Service to be used as a negotiating chip in U.S. trade talks.“We do want a trade deal with the U.S. and we have been absolutely clear that the NHS will not be part of it,” Hancock told BBC radio. “We are crystal clear that it isn’t an area on which we’re prepared to give ground.”He also said drug pricing will not be on the table during the negotiations, and ruled out discussions on changes to drug-patent rules.“Why would we give the Americans more money for drugs when I spend my time battling to get drugs onto the NHS at a price the NHS can afford?” he said. “The point of trade deals is to get prices down, not to have prices up.”Labour Keeps Up NHS Attack Line (Earlier)Labour’s trade spokesman Barry Gardiner warned that Boris Johnson’s approach to a U.S. trade deal would lead to further privatization on the National Health Service. His comments continued Labour’s attack lines from Wednesday, when the opposition party published government accounts of meetings between British and American trade officials.Gardiner told BBC radio that the documents showed officials discussed longer patents to protect drug makers and, he said, illustrated how U.S. companies might get full market access to the U.K. health service.“The potential cost of that to the NHS would just pull the guts out of the services that we were able to provide for people and force further privatization,” he said. “This is how you destroy the health service from within. You force people to go private by not being able any longer to provide a full comprehensive range of services.”Parties Likely to Break New Fiscal Rules (Earlier)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid and his opposition rival John McDonnell are on course to break the fiscal rules they announced less than a month ago, according to research claims by the Resolution Foundation.Even a tiny downgrade to the economic outlook could force a Tory government to raise taxes, return to austerity or abandon its new rules, the London-based think tank said. A Labour government would find itself in a similar position and have to row back on several big manifesto commitments.Earlier:Key Poll Predicts Big Majority for Johnson to Deliver BrexitU.K. Election: The Key Party PromisesU.K. Parties Given Little Chance of Achieving New Fiscal RulesIs Corbyn an Anti-Semite?

She had travelled countless times before but always with her father, who had taken care of everything. It was the first time the 26-year-old had flown alone and she was finding it all a bit daunting. “My father didn’t like me going on trips without him or my brother, and I had always respected his wishes,” Eman, who asked that her surname not be published, told the Telegraph. “He was worried about what I would do if I had too much independence.” Under Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system, women had to rely on the permission of male relatives to leave the country and, in some cases, even to leave the home. But a royal decree issued in August ruled that women over the age of 21 could travel abroad and apply for a passport without a guardian&#39;s permission. Eman felt emboldened by the decree to tell her father that she would be travelling alone this time for a business meeting in Beirut, where she hoped to find new clients for her fledgling beauty company.

But despite the reforms, women in Saudi told the Telegraph that the country’s laws continue to work against them to prevent them from travelling. Male guardians can still file cases of filial &quot;disobedience&quot;, a crime which can lead to forcible return to their guardian’s home or imprisonment in a women’s shelter. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun (C) accompanied by Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chryistia Freeland (R), arrives at Toronto Pearson International Airport after escaping her &quot;abusive&quot; family   Credit: Reuters A legal provision known as &quot;taghayyub&quot; in Arabic, meaning “absent”, could also be invoked if a woman runs away from home without permission. Just this month it was reported that Princess Basmah Bint Saud Bin Abdul Aziz, the youngest daughter of deposed King Saud, was arrested trying to board a flight from the city of Jeddah to Geneva. The princess’ US lawyer said that following her detention the 55-year-old, who had campaigned for women&#39;s rights among other issues, “just fell off the radar” and has not been heard from since. “Even if they get to the airport with their documents and there is no physical restriction on their travel, women’s fathers or husbands could call up airport officials and tell them that they had been ‘disobedient’,” Rothna Begum, women&#39;s rights researcher for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. “There are still many parts of the law that continue to work against women.” Ms Begum said the decision marked a big step towards dismantling the guardianship system, but cautioned that women’s rights were yet to be fully enshrined. “The decree does not appear to positively affirm women’s right to travel abroad, as is their right under international law, and because it is not specific in its wording there are loopholes,” she said. Dua (L) and Dalal (R) al-Showaiki used Twitter to document their escape from their family from Turkey In another example, divorced mothers also spoke of how they feared they would not be able to travel with their children. More often than not in Saudi men win primary custody in a divorce, meaning mothers are required to get the permission of the father to fly with their children. One woman, who holds dual Saudi-Canadian citizenship, said she wanted to her two children to see her parents in Ottawa but her ex-husband had not given her permission for them to go. The royal court decision followed a series of high-profile cases of Saudi women attempting to flee the kingdom. Critics say they likely put pressure on a crown prince increasingly concerned about his image abroad, which has already been dented by the mass arrest of women’s rights activists and the brutal murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. Eighteen-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun barricaded herself in a hotel room in Bangkok in January claiming she had been imprisoned and abused by her father back in Saudi and wanted to claim asylum. A few months later, sisters Dua, 22, and Dalal al-Showaiki, 20, escaped during a family holiday in Turkey, claiming they too had suffered at the hands of their father and were being forced into arranged marriages. The rights of women have been held back not only by the country’s laws, but by its deep religious conservatism. In Saudi’s male-dominant culture, men largely have ultimate authority over women and many are resistant to the reforms. Jawhara, 30, a housewife from Riyadh told this paper during a recent visit that she was lucky to have a supportive husband, but said there were many more women that do not. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has led the reforms to modernise Saudi but has also faced criticism for the mass arrest of women&#39;s rights activists Credit: AFP “I think modern families like mine will allow their daughters, sisters, mothers and wives to travel freely, but you must keep in mind the reserved parts of society which makes up a significant chunk of the country,” she said, not wishing to give her full name. “While change from the top matters there must also be change within the society itself. Women will continue to try to escape as long as they&#39;re treated like second-class citizens and I am glad they now have the means to.” The number of Saudis seeking asylum abroad has increased sevenfold in recent years. Saudis made at least 815 asylum claims worldwide in 2017, which includes both men and women, compared with 195 in 2012, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency&#39;s database. Rights group say this can be partly attributed to the opening up of social media in the kingdom, which has exposed women to freedoms experienced in the West. Toby Cadman, a British human rights lawyer who is helping Dua and Dalal’s claim for asylum, told the Telegraph that he has been contacted by more than 10 Saudi women asking for help, several of which since the August decree. “I had one recently who was the daughter of a Saudi diplomat in Africa. The woman was unmarried and in her 30s, so still considered to be under the protection of her father,” said Mr Cadman, co-founder of law firm Guernica 37. “She was effectively being kept under lock and key in the compound.” Mr Cadman gave her the advice to try to escape, but her father had her passport and she was too afraid of the punishment she would receive if she was caught. “For her, and many others like her, it made little difference that the laws had changed,” he said. In the case of Dua and Dalal, whose situation became public after they launched a Twitter campaign asking for help, the sisters’ parents have gone to some lengths to bring them home. The father, whom they describe as controlling and abusive, asked the Saudi embassy to help facilitate their return. Staff told the sisters to come to the consulate to collect new passports, which Mr Cadman believes was a rouse. Mr Cadman said there were common themes in all the cases: men fearing a loss of control over the women under their “guardianship” and familial honour. “The new decree makes almost no difference at all to the average woman in Saudi,” he said. “It cannot just be a change in the law, it needs to be a change in the mindset, a change in thinking. That will take some time.” Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/saudi-laws-continue-hold-women-175826668.html,28/11/2019

The French President’s stark appraisal of the transatlantic alliance was given short shrift by EU allies who want to bind Nato countries closer together in the face of threats from Russia and other aggressors. Ahead of a Nato meeting on the outskirts of London next week which will be attended by President Donald Trump and the leaders of the other 28 member countries, President Macron claimed his remarks served as a “wake-up call” to spur the alliance into redefining its strategic goals and asking “who’s the enemy?” But The Daily Telegraph understands that Mr Macron’s comments received no support in a Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels last week, with Germany his harshest critic. EU leaders believe Europe needs still to rely heavily on Nato for its defence. European countries are keen to present a united front in the face of criticism of Nato from Mr Trump, who announced yesterday that he will reduce America’s contribution to the Nato budget. Foreign Office sources suggested Mr Macron was trying to play to a domestic audience, as he is expected to urge allies to participate more in fighting the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in the Sahel region of West Africa following the deaths of 13 French soldiers in a helicopter collision. French President Emmanuel Macron said Nato must define its strategic priorities after meeting alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  Credit:  Chesnot/ Getty Images Europe &quot;The questions I have asked are open questions, that we haven&#39;t solved yet,” said the French president after a meeting in Paris with Nato&#39;s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg. &quot;Peace in Europe, the post-INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty) situation, the relationship with Russia, the Turkey issue, who&#39;s the enemy?,” he asked. “As long as these questions are not resolved, let&#39;s not negotiate about cost-sharing and burden-sharing, or this that.&quot; &quot;So we maybe needed a wake-up call. I&#39;m glad it was delivered, and I&#39;m glad everyone now thinks we should rather think about our strategic goals,&quot; said Mr Macron. In this month’s the Economist, the French president warned that a lack of American willingness to defend its members had placed Europe &quot;on the edge of the precipice”. &quot;I’d argue that we should reassess the reality of what Nato is in the light of the commitment of the United States,&quot; he said, pointing to its unexpected troop withdrawal from north-eastern Syria last month, forsaking its Kurdish allies. The Telegraph understands that President Macron&#39;s comments were widely felt by members attending the Nato Foreign Minister&#39;s meeting in Brussels last week to be mainly for a domestic audience and would not undermine the residual strength of the alliance..  On Thursday, Nato&#39;s chief said that &quot;in uncertain times, we need strong multilateral institutions like Nato,&quot; and that he had &quot;good and open discussions&quot; with the French president. He praised France&#39;s role in Mali against an Islamist insurgency and where it suffered its worst military loss in almost 40 years this week when two helicopters collided. France is to undertake a review of its operation in the Sahel after 13 soldiers died in a helicopter crash in Mali this week Credit: DICOD/HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX Britain has provided helicopters and around 100 security personnel to help France&#39;s 4,500-member Barkhane force in West Africa, and the US provides intelligence support. But Paris, which is acting &quot;on behalf of everyone”, will launch an in-depth review of its involvement with &quot;all options on the table&quot;, said Mr Macron. &quot;A bigger engagement by its allies is obviously something that would be quite positive,&quot; he said. US president Donald Trump has repeatedly accused European Nato members of failing to meet commitments to spend at least two percent of GDP on defence. By way of response, Mr Macron said that &quot;our common enemy is the terrorism that has struck us all”. &quot;If some people want to see an example of what they term &#39;cost-sharing&#39;, they can come Monday to the ceremony France is organising&quot; for the 13 soldiers killed in the Mali accident. &quot;There they will see the cost.” US President Donald Trump has berated Nato members for failing to meet their defence spending commitments Credit:  UPI / Barcroft Media The US on Thursday announced it is to cut its contribution to Nato’s operating budget with Germany meeting the shortfall. Washington was previously the biggest contributor, paying about 22 per cent. Now the US and Germany will both pay roughly 16 per cent. Mr Macron also defended French attempts to renew ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which has riled EU leaders, calling for a &quot;lucid, robust and demanding dialogue&quot;. Russia has called on the US and other countries to declare a moratorium on the deployment of short and mid-range nuclear missiles in Europe after a treaty banning such a move formally ended in August. Mr Macron said that while France had &quot;absolutely not accepted&quot; the proposal, “we shouldn&#39;t just brush it off&quot;. &quot;Let&#39;s be serious, this is the security of Europe we&#39;re talking about,&quot; he said, adding that Europe must be involved in talks on any new pact.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/emmanuel-macron-defends-nato-brain-175036475.html,28/11/2019

The YouGov survey, which used a technique that stood up well in 2017, suggested the Tories would win 359 of the 650 seats in Parliament. That would be a gain of 42 on the last election, and a majority of 68. Labour would drop more than 50 seats to 211, the survey showed. There were caveats in the gloom for Labour: YouGov pointed to 30 seats it sees swinging to the Tories where the current margin is still less than 5%. Corbyn has two weeks to shift the momentum in those areas, which voted to leave the European Union and where he’s losing votes to Johnson’s pro-Brexit message.Today’s Must-ReadsParty leaders (minus Johnson) will debate climate change on Channel 4 this evening. Slow news outlet Tortoise looks at what the manifestos say about the path to net-zero emissions. Is Jeremy Corbyn an antisemite? It no longer matters, Therese Raphael argues for Bloomberg Opinion. Labour’s Brexit plan is far more attractive than Boris Johnson’s, Martin Wolf writes in the Financial Times. “But do I trust Mr Corbyn’s Labour with my country? No.”Brexit in BriefChanging Tack | Labour will change its approach in Leave-voting areas in a bid to win over people who are skeptical about its Brexit policy, the BBC reports. The strategy will focus on trying to convince voters that Labour support for a new referendum is not a bid to remain in the EU “by the back door,” the BBC said.Ghost of Columns Past | The prime minister came under fire for remarks made in columns published earlier in his career. Writing in the Spectator in 1995 he called single mothers “uppity and irresponsible” and working class men “feckless and hopeless.” The Guardian reported that in 1999 he wrote a diary piece in the Independent describing young people’s interest in money as “almost Nigerian.”Sixteen-Year Low | Net migration to the U.K. from the EU fell to its lowest level since 2003 in the year through June, preliminary Office for National Statistics estimates published on Thursday show.Bouncing Back? | U.K. house prices increased at their fastest pace in more than a year this month, according to Nationwide Building Society. Values rose 0.5% in November from October, the biggest advance since July 2018. U.K. housing activity has been undermined by the ongoing Brexit process since the 2016 referendum.Cash Boost | Labour brought in £3.49 million ($4.5 million) in donations of more than £7,500 from Nov. 13-19, the Electoral Commission said. That compared to £2.97 million for the Conservatives, £2.25 million for the Brexit Party and £251,000 for the Liberal Democrats.Winning Streak | The pound headed for a fourth month of gains against the euro, reflecting growing confidence in the market that the Conservative Party will be able to secure a majority. Sterling traded at €1.1735 on Thursday afternoon, meaning one euro costs about 85 pence.Want to keep up with Brexit?You can follow us @Brexit on Twitter, and listen to Bloomberg Westminster every weekday.

The invaders retreated back into Rwanda after the attack, Burundi said. “Burundi avails itself of this opportunity to warn Rwanda against these repetitive and multifaceted attacks against Burundi and wants the international community to take note,” the government’s spokesman, Prosper Ntahorwamiye, told reporters on Thursday in Bujumbura. “In case of recidivism, the government of the Republic of Burundi reserves the right of legitimate defense.”The Rwandan army’s spokesman, Innocent Munyengango, dismissed the allegation and asked Burundi for evidence. “If we were to do it, it would be in broad daylight,” he said by phone from the capital, Kigali.Burundi reported past incidents of aggression to the United Nations, the African Union and the East African Community but none of the international organizations responded or censured Rwanda for the alleged actions.“If nothing is done, such acts by Rwanda against Burundi constitute a threat to the peace and security of the entire African Great Lakes region,” Ntahorwamiye said.&#92;--With assistance from Saul Butera.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Desire Nimubona in Bujumbura at dnimubona@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Malingha at dmalingha@bloomberg.net, Helen NyamburaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/burundi-accuses-rwanda-armed-attack-140539215.html,28/11/2019

Richard Ratcliffe, in a letter to the prime minister released this week, said he felt Mr Johnson had made “placebo promises” to see that 40-year-old Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was released, which he has not kept. Mr Ratcliffe said he sent the letter to Mr Johnson two weeks ago but has not received a reply. He said the prime minister has ignored all pleas for contact since entering No 10, despite promising as Foreign Secretary to “leave no stone unturned”. Now he feels he has no choice but to go public with his most heart-rending appeal yet in the three-and-a-half years since his wife’s arrest by Iranian authorities on espionage charges. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman charity worker, has been mentally suffering in prison in Tehran Credit: Family handout “Enough is enough. How can this be allowed to happen without the PM explaining what he is doing about it? If you take responsibility for the country you have to take responsibility for obvious mistakes,&quot; he writes. “Our story defines what a British passport is worth on your watch,” Mr Ratcliffe said. “The job of a PM is not just to make headlines, but in the end to make a difference. That starts with protecting citizens at their most vulnerable, home and abroad.” He said Mr Johnson was responsible for the imprisonment of more British-Iranian dual nationals in Iran. At least three Iranians holding British nationality have been arrested by Tehran in the last year, as relations worsened with the Islamic Republic. In his letter he revealed his wife is now so des­­perate she has spoken of taking an overdose. “Nazanin says how she no longer wants to live through what they are doing to her,” he wrote. “Those in power do not care enough to solve it, and she cannot keep going like this. She has lost hope, lost everything, in bottomless waiting.” Five-year-old Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her father Richard during a press conference at the Houses of Parliament, following Gabriella&#39;s return to the UK so she can attend school. Credit: PA The Ratcliffe family made the decision to bring daughter Gabriella, five, home to London from Tehran, where she had been living with her grandparents and paying visits to her mother in Evin prison.

In a statement, Mahdi said that his decision would allow Iraq to &quot;preserve the blood of its people, and avoid slipping into a cycle of violence, chaos and devastation,&quot; although a successor has not been named.     At least 400 protesters have been killed since the beginning of October, with 40 shot dead by security forces in three cities Thursday and early Friday. The demonstrators, a mix of educated, urban idealists and working-class Shiite Muslims, have been protesting perceived government corruption, as well as unemployment and what they see as Iran&#39;s influence over the country.More stories from theweek.com  5 gut-bustingly funny cartoons about politics and Thanksgiving  Democrats are running into Trump&#39;s economic buzzsaw  Impeachment is failing.

Adel Abdel Mahdi, who took up the post of premier last year, said he would submit to the parliament a formal letter requesting my resignation to &quot;preserve the blood&quot; of Iraqis. Demonstrators greed the news with cheers, throwing rice and dancing to music in Baghdad&#39;s Tahrir (Liberation) Square. “Long live the revolution, long live the heroes. Thank you to the people,” one protester said over a loudspeaker. Mr Mahdi’s decision came hours after Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, Iraq&#39;s top Shia Muslim cleric, gave a sermon urging lawmakers to reconsider their support for the government, in a major boost to Iraqi demonstrators who have taken to the streets against a ruling class. &quot;It&#39;s our first victory, and we&#39;re hoping for many more,&quot; shouted one demonstrator. &quot;It&#39;s also a victory for the martyrs who fell,&quot; he said. An Iraqi anti-government protester waves a national flag close to a concrete barricade amidst clashes with security forces along the capital Baghdad&#39;s Rasheed street Credit: AFP Mr Mahdi’s resignation was one of the protesters’ demands, but it is unlikely to see them leave the streets after the crackdown by security forces. More than 45 were reported dead in just a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday night, in an unprecedented level of violence against protesters by the government. Some 26 people were killed in the southern city of Nasiriyah after security forces tried to clear one of the main bridges into the city, 12 were killed in the holy city of Najaf and four in the capital, Baghdad. The demonstrations are the largest the country has seen in decades, but also the deadliest, with nearly 400 people killed and more than 15,000 wounded since they began last month. Iraq&#39;s &quot;enemies and their apparatuses are trying to sow chaos and infighting to return the country to the age of dictatorship ... everyone must work together to thwart that opportunity,&quot; Mr Sistani said. The government &quot;appears to have been unable to deal with the events of the past two months&quot; and &quot;parliament, from which the current government emerged, must reconsider its choices and do what&#39;s in the interest of Iraq,&quot; he said, urging them to stop killing protesters. Iraqi protesters carry the Iraqi national flag and shout slogans shortly after the resignation of Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi Credit: REX The unrest in Iraq&#39;s south was unleashed after protesters stormed the Iranian consulate in Najaf late on Wednesday, accusing the neighbouring country of propping up Iraq&#39;s government. Tehran demanded Iraq take decisive action against the protesters, saying it was &quot;disgusted&quot; by developments. In response, Mr Mahdi, who has received Iran&#39;s support, ordered military chiefs to deploy in several provinces to &quot;impose security and restore order&quot; - but chaos reigned instead. Men in civilian clothes opened fire at demonstrators and tribal fighters deployed in the streets in their defence. &quot;We had blocked off the roads and bridges over the past four days and security forces moved in on us to try to open up the bridges. They opened fire leading to a bloodbath,&quot; said Hussein, a 32-year-old lawyer from Nasiriyah. &quot;What&#39;s happening in Nasiriya is unbelievable. Nothing justifies this use of violence against us. We, the people, are extremely angry. Our blood is boiling. Our brothers were killed unjustifiably. Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International&#39;s Middle East research director, also used the word &quot;bloodbath&quot; to describe the crackdown in Nasiriyah and accused security forces of &quot;appalling violence against largely peaceful protesters&quot;.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/iraqi-pm-offers-resignation-security-131228105.html,29/11/2019

Korea on Cryptocurrency"" border=""0"" ></a>Jack Taylor/GettyA former computer hacker who styles himself as a corruption-buster has been charged with flouting U.S. law to give North Korea advice on evading American sanctions by using cryptocurrency.Virgil Griffith, 36, was once dubbed an “internet man of mystery” by The New York Times. He has an Ph.D from the California Institute of Technology and works for Eretheum, which produces a digital currency token that’s a rival to Bitcoin.According to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Griffith sought permission from U.S. authorities to attend the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference in North Korea in April.He was denied but allegedly went anyway and recruited others to travel to North Korea to aid the government there, as well.The Justice Department alleges that, while giving a presentation titled “Blockchain and Peace,” Griffith described how North Korea could “launder money and evade sanctions” and “use these technologies to achieve independence from the global banking system.” Griffith—an American citizen who has been living in Singapore—hoped the cryptocurrency made by his own company, unnamed in the complaint, would be North Korea’s choice, the feds charged.The North Korean regime allegedly approved his talk. Governments across the world, including the United States, have largely shut the country out over human rights abuses and efforts to build nuclear weapons. Prior the conference, Griffith allegedly exchanged messages with an associate about North Korea’s potential use cryptocurrency that appear to demonstrate he knew the illegality of what he was doing.“I need to send 1 unit of [Cryptocurrency-1, which belonged to Griffith’s company] between North and South Korea,” he wrote.“Isn’t that avoiding sanctions,” his associate asked.“It is,” Griffith wrote, according to the complaint.He was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport Thanksgiving Day and arraigned Friday. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. An Alabama native, Griffith reportedly became a hacker in college then invented WikiScanner, which exposes anonymous edits to Wikipedia entries, after graduation.A website that appears to belong to him, but which has not been updated since 2016, says: “My goals are to expose corruption, curb abuses of power, and with ‘gloves off’ ensure the digital age never becomes a digital dystopia.”The magazine, 2600: The Hacker Quarterly called Griffith’s arrest “an attack on all of us.”“Yes, we are biased because we know this person and his motivations, which align with hacker culture: explaining tech, visiting weird places, & being honest. These are not crimes in our eyes,” it said in a tweet.2600 editor Emmanuel Goldstein said in a tweet that Griffith did not believe he had done anything wrong.“Crap. He insisted on going to the @FBI and telling the truth w/o a lawyer. I kept warning him it was a trap. What&#39;s ironic is that afterwards, he was convinced they totally got where he was coming from,” he wrote.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A businessman found dead after telling the authorities about a Chinese plot to install him in Parliament. Suspicious men following critics of Beijing in major Australian cities.For a country that just wants calm commerce with China -- the propellant behind 28 years of steady growth -- the revelations of the past week have delivered a jolt.Fears of Chinese interference once seemed to hover indistinctly over Australia. Now, Beijing&#39;s political ambitions, and the espionage operations that further them, suddenly feel local, concrete and ever-present.&quot;It&#39;s become the inescapable issue,&quot; said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. &quot;We&#39;ve underestimated how quickly China&#39;s power has grown along with its ambition to use that power.&quot;U.S. officials often describe Australia as a test case, the ally close enough to Beijing to see what could be coming for others.In public and in private, they&#39;ve pushed Australia&#39;s leaders to confront China more directly -- pressure that may only grow after President Donald Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong.Even as it confronts the specter of brazen espionage, Australia&#39;s government has yet to draw clear boundaries for an autocratic giant that is both an economic partner and a threat to freedom -- a conundrum faced by many countries, but more acutely by Australia.Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to insist that Australia need not choose between China and the United States. A new foreign interference law has barely been enforced, and secrecy is so ingrained that even lawmakers and experts lack the in-depth information they need.As a result, the country&#39;s intelligence agencies have raised alarms about China in ways that most Australian politicians avoid. The agencies have never been flush with expertise on China, including Chinese speakers, yet they are now in charge of disentangling complex claims of nefarious deeds, all vigorously denied by China.In the most troubling recent case, first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, the Australian authorities have confirmed that they are investigating accusations made by Nick Zhao, an Australian businessman who told intelligence officials that he had been the target of a plot to install him in Parliament as a Chinese agent.Zhao, a 32-year-old luxury car dealer, was a member of his local Liberal Party branch. He was a &quot;perfect target for cultivation,&quot; according to Andrew Hastie, a federal lawmaker and tough critic of Beijing who was briefed on the case. He told The Age that Zhao was &quot;a bit of a high-roller in Melbourne, living beyond his means.&quot;Another businessman with ties to the Chinese government, Zhao said, offered to provide 1 million Australian dollars ($677,000) to finance his election campaign for Parliament. But a few months later, in March, Zhao was found dead in a hotel room. The state&#39;s coroner is investigating the cause of death.In a rare statement, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia&#39;s domestic spy agency, said Monday that his organization was aware of Zhao&#39;s case and was taking it very seriously.The Chinese government, however, called the accusations a sign of Australian hysteria.&quot;Stories like &#39;Chinese espionage&#39; or &#39;China&#39;s infiltration in Australia,&#39; with however bizarre plots and eye-catching details, are nothing but lies,&quot; the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a regular news briefing Monday.Beijing has similarly dismissed the case that emerged last week, which involves a young asylum-seeker named Wang Liqiang.Wang presented himself to the Australian authorities as an important intelligence asset -- an assistant to a Hong Kong businessman who Wang says is responsible for spying, propaganda and disinformation campaigns aimed at quashing dissent in Hong Kong and undermining democracy in Taiwan.China asserts that he is simply a convicted swindler. On Thursday, a Communist Party tabloid, The Global Times, released video of what it said was Wang&#39;s 2016 trial on fraud charges, where a young man confessed to bilking someone out of $17,000.Xiang Xin, the man Wang identified as his former boss, has denied having anything to do with him, or even knowing him.The challenge of the case is just beginning. While some analysts have raised doubts about Wang&#39;s assertions, elements in the detailed 17-page account that he gave to the authorities as part of an asylum application are being taken seriously by law enforcement agencies worldwide.Taiwan&#39;s Ministry of Justice detained Xiang and another executive with the company Wang said he worked for, China Innovation Investment Limited. Investigators in Taiwan are looking into assertions that their business acted on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies.Other details in Wang&#39;s account -- about the kidnapping of booksellers in Hong Kong, spying on Hong Kong university students, and the theft of military technology from the United States -- are still being examined by Australian officials.&quot;Australia&#39;s peak intelligence agencies are being put to the test,&quot; said John Fitzgerald, a China specialist at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. &quot;It&#39;s a tough call, and they cannot afford to get it wrong.&quot;What&#39;s clear, though, is that they are helping to push the public away from supporting cozy relations. Polls showed a hardening of Australian attitudes about China even before the past week.Now Hastie, the China hawk and Liberal Party lawmaker who chairs Parliament&#39;s joint intelligence committee, says his office has been overwhelmed by people across the country who have emailed, called and even sent handwritten letters expressing outrage and anxiety about China&#39;s actions in Australia.Questions of loyalty continue to swirl around another Liberal Party member of Parliament, Gladys Liu, who fumbled responses to questions in September about her membership in various groups linked to the Chinese Communist Party.The espionage cases also follow several months of rising tensions at Australian universities, where protests by students from Hong Kong have been disrupted, sometimes with violence, by opponents from the Chinese mainland.Several student activists have told the authorities that they have been followed or photographed by people who appear to be associated with the Chinese Consulate.It&#39;s even happened to at least one high-profile former official, John Garnaut. A longtime journalist who produced a classified report on Chinese interference for former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, he recently acknowledged publicly that he had been stalked by people who appeared to be Chinese agents -- in some cases when he was with his family.These actions of apparent aggression point to a version of China that Australians hardly know. For decades, Australia has based its relations with Beijing on a simple idea: Let&#39;s get rich together. And the mining companies that are especially close to Morrison&#39;s conservative government have been the biggest winners.But now more than ever, the country is seeing that for the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, it&#39;s no longer just about wealth and trade.&quot;The transactions aren&#39;t satisfying them enough; they want more,&quot; said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University. &quot;They want to gain influence over decisions about the further involvement of the United States, about further protestations to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, in the South Pacific, in Taiwan.&quot;Blaxland, along with U.S. officials, often points out that Australia&#39;s biggest export to China, iron ore, is hard to obtain elsewhere reliably and at the prices Australia&#39;s companies charge. That suggests that the country has more leverage than its leaders might think.Hastie, who was recently denied a visa to travel to China as part of a study group that included other members of Parliament, agreed. In an interview, he said the recent revelations were &quot;the first time the Australian public has a concrete example of what we are facing.&quot;Now, he added, it&#39;s time to adapt.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/suddenly-chinese-threat-australia-seems-200729947.html,29/11/2019

She samples old-world delights at a hole-in-the-wall bakery, and tastes what looks to be pistachio ice cream at a bustling market, or “souk” as it’s known in Damascus. Curious young boys surround her, an attraction in her own right—a tourist in a country better known for producing refugees. “It’s too much,” she exclaims, a keffiyeh in the style of the Syrian flag draped around her neck.Eva, who graduated from Oxford before working as a social media professional at a media startup in London, wasn’t in Syria to do journalism, work for the United Nations, or—in a break from past visitors—express solidarity with Bashar al-Assad, whose regime responded to a mass uprising in 2011 by releasing terrorists, shooting civilians, and burning the country. No, she’s an oddity in a country still very much at war: a tourist, one of several adventure-seekers with a high-profile presence on YouTube and Instagram who have recently gone on excursions in this blood-soaked part of the Levant.“I have been to other places that, potentially, you could say have ‘viral potential’ or whatever you want to call it,” Eva told The Daily Beast. Iran. Iraqi Kurdistan. But, when going far off the beaten path, for a Western travel blogger, she said the motive isn’t money. “I went to Syria because I am personally interested in the country,” having met Syrians who told her about a homeland they themselves cannot visit, she said, “not because I was thinking about [YouTube] views or anything like that.”Such a trip would not be unusual in 2010, when 8.5 million tourists reportedly visited Syria. “Discover wonderful old Damascene houses, admire the mesmerizing gold mosaics of Umayyad Mosque, or savour the silence of the Palmyra ruins,” states a travel guide from Lonely Planet, last updated more than a decade ago. A lot has happened in that time. For one, there are now more ruins.At least 400,000 people had been killed as of April 2016, when the United Nations stopped counting; a month before, the international governing body accused the Syrian government of carrying out a policy of terror—of barrel bombs, sarin and chlorine gas—that amounts to the crime of “extermination.” Many of the 259,000 people who worked in tourism in 2010, according to the Syrian government, are dead or in exile; all had to find other work.Khaldoun Al-Alamy, 53, never left Damascus and is now in a position to benefit from the fact others are, slowly, coming back. From the start of the year until the end of August 2019, a spokesperson for the Syrian Ministry of Tourism said 1.5 million people visited the country, up 61 percent from the same period a year before. Al-Alamy runs a travel agency, Golden Target Tours, and he’s the one who arranged Eva’s trip. He told me he’s been fielding a slew of inquiries since she gave him a shout out, online.Hosn Castle, also known as Krak des Chevaliers.Mohamed AzakirOver the phone, he gave the same pitch he’s been desperately giving the last few years about Syria’s historical sites and friendly people, when his career became more a passion. “You can visit the biggest mosque in the area, the bazaar, the oldest church, old houses, everything,” he said. There’s an ancient Roman amphitheater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, south of the capital in Bosra, and a medieval castle, Krak des Chevaliers, up north, near the border with Lebanon. His most popular tour, however, is for three nights in the capital. This, he said, has been his best year since war destroyed whatever business he had.“When you see the people coming and visiting and shopping, and the restaurants are all full,” he said between fits of coughing, “that gives you a really very nice, very positive feeling. You feel like life is returning. Life is normal. That there’s a future.”Tourists began returning in larger numbers after the Syrian regime crushed what was left of the armed resistance in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, and Daraa, a province just south of the capital and considered by many to be the seat of the revolution. In early 2011, schoolchildren there were arrested over anti-regime graffiti—for telling “the doctor,” their opthamologist turned dictator, that he would be next to fall in the Arab Spring. One was subsequently tortured to death, the return of their 13-year-old body causing the town to erupt in protest, believing a better world was possible. In Syria, at least, it wasn’t, the world watching as the doctor set the country ablaze.* * *Today’s visitors are different than those who came before the war, when Syria was repressed but enjoying a false peace. “Most of them are young people, educated,” al-Alamy told me. “This is very important, because those people will be our ambassadors, let’s say, outside,” he said. And most are happy to fill that role; to boast of their adventures in a place that’s been barrel-bombed off the map of most other travelers.In Damascus, what’s long been a police state has long since been militarized. “There’s a checkpoint on every corner,” Joan Townsend Torres, a 31-year-old Spaniard who visited in 2018 and has authored a guide for those who wish to follow in his footsteps. And there are other military installations, he recalled, that make traditional tourist activities, like snapping photos of everything, a bit more risky, especially in a locale that associates photography with journalism—with subversion.“I always walk around with my big camera hanging from my shoulder,” Joan told me. And he had a number of conversations with soldiers asking him what he was up to, and insisting on a review of his photos. Most people, he said, are just happy to learn he’s not a reporter; that he’s a tourist, instead, “means that the country’s changing.”Outside the country, Joan said, the response is different.“You receive a lot of emails and messages from people… [who] are really, really angry that [someone] went to Syria because it’s, like, supporting the government and it’s unethical,” Joan acknowledged. Still, “I don’t think there’s anything bad about it. I mean, I didn’t take selfies with destroyed buildings behind me.”The actual number of visitors cannot be independently verified, and one tour operator in Damascus, “Ayoub,” requesting anonymity as “the situation is very sensitive,” said the government’s figures are almost certainly inflated, counting anyone who crosses the border, for any reason, as a “tourist.” But more are in fact coming. Excluding Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan, just under 142,000 foreigners officially stepped foot in Syria during the first two-thirds of 2019, according to the Ministry of Tourism, up 17 percent from the year before.“We don’t have a lot of tourists,” the tour operator in Damascus noted. “But now we have more.”Before the conflict, it was, generally, history—those ancient ruins in Palmyra, since desecrated by ISIS—that brought the tour groups. And history, generally, attracts an older crowd. During the height of the war, when rebel mortars still threatened neighborhoods in Damascus, visitors still came, but in solidarity: fascists who see allies in Baathism; anti-imperialists who see the leading contributor to violence in Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as a victim of a failed international conspiracy to forcibly change his regime.A general view shows ruins in the historic city of Palmyra, Syria March 4, 2017.Omar Sanadiki“The main reason for tourism now, it’s just, like, to show off, you know?” the Damascus tour operator told me. It’s a younger, more online set, eager to “show off on the social media to get some followers [and] a lot of likes.”It’s not inherently evil, that. Who doesn’t want to be liked? Nor is it fair to say those who go to Syria have not grappled with the ethics of that decision; they have ultimately decided it is okay, of course, but they are not oblivious. The question is really whether Syria is exceptional — that is, while visitors insist they are not doing politics, is it possible not to? Or, as some maintain, is it really no different than visiting anywhere else in the world with a less than stellar head of state? There is a difference, of course: almost nowhere is as bad as Syria, a condemnation of its regime more than absolution for any other. And there are millions in a diaspora who cannot do what a white tourist can: step foot in their homeland. On an emotional level, the tourists I interviewed understood this, even if they ultimately rejected the logic for boycotting travel to Syria. It’s not lost on their tour operators, either.“Yeah, I know this,” the Damascus tour operator confessed, after a pregnant silence, when I asked if he could understand some Syrians’ anger toward the mostly European tourists who purchase his services. “I lost my home during the war,” he said, and “a lot of my friends” are now abroad, most in Germany. They cannot enter regime-held Syria, suspected of opposition sympathies or wanted for military service—or subject to arrest just for leaving the country without permission.Native-born Germans, on the other hand: “When they start seeing the refugees, they get more curious to go to that country to see where these people came from,” he said. “They meet a Syrian and they start talking and they [the Syrian] tell them, like, ‘I wish I could go back to my country.’” And so they, the Germans, visit on their behalf “and bring him something from the ground.”Others, on the “influencer” end of the spectrum, can sometimes be less admirable, treating the source of so much pain in this young and brutal 21st century as a playground—another stop on a social media tour, with an expectation that with Insta-fame comes generosity, toward them. One, the operator said, “chose to arrive here on Ramadan, because they give a lot of [free] meals. And she stayed on CouchSurfing with a Syrian girl. And so she traveled without spending any money.”He himself would like to travel to Italy someday, but that would cost something far beyond the means of most Syrians; they are lucky to make $100 a month these days, down from $1,000 before the war, or what most in government-controlled areas term “the conflict,” so as to not suggest parity between sides. And so this tour operator, in school to become the sort of licensed guide to this police state’s foreign visitors, has never been a tourist himself. “I grew up during the war,” he explained. “I didn’t have a chance.”Most refugees are destitute, and while some who stayed behind were able to do so thanks to their wealth and power, not fearing arbitrary arrest or worse, many others lacked the means to head somewhere not at war. And it’s too late now. In an age of militarized borders, where the hypocrisies of liberal internationalism have given way to the open malice of right-wing authoritarianism, where would they go? Doors are closing, and many of those who did make it out can never return in the absence of a change in regime. Those who can safely visit Syria are those with no public record of criticizing the government, or any demonstrable ties to those who have. A wrong bet—a mistaken faith in Damascus’ haphazard talk of reconciliation—can result in one disappearing in a torture chamber like Sednaya, a prison where “Syrian authorities have quietly and methodically organized the killing of thousands of people in their custody,” according to Amnesty International. A correct assessment of the risk, however, can also lead one to sip wine and post selfies to Instagram just outside that detention center, like Russian state propagandists and French fascists, such guests of honor spared the need for a regime minder.The contradiction between sight-seeing and immense human suffering is not lost on all who come. After the normalcy of Damascus, Eva visited Aleppo to see ruins that weren’t on any tourist’s agenda prior to 2011. Her tone, as she walks among the half of the city once occupied by rebels, and destroyed by the government, is markedly different: “This isn’t fun,” would be any viewer’s takeaway.“I just felt, frankly, quite saddened by the whole situation,” Eva told me later, speaking as she walked the streets of her latest stop, Mexico City. “And I think it is absolutely tragic that people who are from the country cannot come back.” She’s been to other politically fraught destinations, including Iran and Yemen. But her pre-war interest in Syria, she said, was renewed by a flight from Dubai. The man in the seat next to her was originally from Syria, and unable to return. “You can probably go as a foreigner,” she recalls him saying. “Just, if you go, can you please just kiss Aleppo for me?”“I think that Syria is a destination that you can only visit if you’re prepared to be uncomfortable,” Eva told me, “and potentially be in a situation that is not safe—and be prepared to be extremely sensitive,” said, “because this is not a beach in Thailand.”The Syrian government has, in its haphazard way, promoted the idea that it kind of is, though. On its YouTube channel, the Syrian Ministry of Tourism posts footage of young people in bikinis enjoying the emerald waters off the coast of Latakia; amid the 2016 siege of Aleppo, Syrian state media published video boasting of the “thriving nightlife” in the government-held Western half of the city.Tourists who visit tend to highlight the same things as the regime’s propagandists: the good, not the bad. This isn’t because most are shills for a government that is largely responsible for the worst bloodshed most of us have seen in our lifetime. It’s the limits of the genre: travel bloggers are not journalists, and travel blogging is not journalism.But isn’t it, really? Going to a foreign land and reporting back on what you saw is awfully close to what someone called a “reporter” would do. In this age of mass media layoffs, however, the role of the professional is increasingly filled by independent amateurs. That the Syrian state allows in the latter may not be an explicit propaganda strategy, but that some tourists are active and influential on social media—and uninterested in politicizing their experience or explaining who killed who, if they even know enough to speculate—is undoubtedly a service to the cause of normalizing a rogue, murderous state.Eva is no apologist for tyranny in Syria anymore than she, by visiting the United States, is a de facto supporter of Donald Trump. She is, again, a travel blogger eager to describe her excursions, which often take her to places with complex political realities on which she does not opine. Indeed, when it comes to politics and travel, “I don’t know [that] there’s a relation between those two things,” she told me.Perhaps it is unfair to expect sophisticated political analysis from a tourist on a short excursion; perhaps, in fact, it is better that they refrain and save us and them the embarrassment of a half-baked perspective, informed by taxi drivers and Wikipedia. But its absence speaks, too.I, for one, was initially unfair toward Eva, answering her video from Damascus with social media posts of my own, thinking her engaged in propaganda, conscious or not. How ghoulish, I maintained, to omit the war—to assert from the start that this elephant would not be discussed—while celebrating a capital, bloated by the internally displaced from wrecked suburbs, as a tourist destination like any other. But in her eyes, and in her approach, that is exactly what it was and remains: a place on Earth, unique, with beautiful sites, friendly people and messy politics.* * *Syria isn’t really like any other place, though. More than half its population has been displaced. Activists aren’t just spied on and harassed by police, but tortured and killed—just blocks away from where you, the useful traveler, may have raved about the dessert.If something is perceived as propaganda, does it matter then if that was not the intent? If it’s unthinking, that may just mean it’s more effective.“I mean, I don’t think it’s possible to be apolitical in this context!” said Yasmin Fedda, a filmmaker whose 2012 documentary, A Tale of Two Syrias, explored the lives of pre-war Damascenes, and the brutality and hardship that precipitated an uprising. “It’s very naive to think so and shows a lack of understanding.”Fedda is one of nearly 100 Syrian filmmakers who signed an October 14 open letter signed by decrying the “increasingly common” practice of regime-approved, foreign directors using unreconstructed war zones in their productions. “These devastated towns and cities [are] transformed into cinematic backdrops,” they wrote, the scene of war crimes and forced displacement “used as movie sets for regime-sponsored films.”Tourists may be subject to less intensive vetting, but they are welcomed for the same reason: to be, as the tour operator al-Alamy said, “ambassadors”—to promote a positive image of the country abroad; to do what travel bloggers do everywhere they go: present their experiences in a generally pleasant light that makes others want to do the same, and a touch jealous that they haven’t already.Kristyan Benedict, a campaigner at Amnesty International, thinks likewise. “Any organised tourism will almost certainly be controlled by the Assad regime, which will seek to profit from it financially while using it as a PR tool as part of its campaign to claim Syria is back to normal,” he told me. At the same time, “Tourists who venture into Syria should be aware of the very grave risks—including kidnapping and car bombs—and be prepared to massively self-censor or risk falling foul of Assad’s intelligence forces,” he told me. Going at all, he argued, is to lend credibility to a regime eager to use foreign visitors “as a PR tool in its campaign to claim Syria is back to normal.”But after eight years of war, that is also what many Syrians desire: a return, if not to “normal,” to the mundane, everyday repression of a hereditary dictatorship—less cruel, while perversely brutal, if only because it was more confident. A false peace is, at the end of a civil war, preferable to death.* * *Jamila, a 20-something who works as a translator in Damascus, has long been enchanted by the world outside of her own troubled slice of it. She’s never been beyond Lebanon, lacking the opportunity and the money to go any further, but some years back she joined Couchsurfing, a networking website for international travelers. Typically, as the name may suggest, it works like this: tourists find locals willing to put them up, and then they sleep on their couch. Damascus has almost 1,900 such “hosts,” according to the site, but hosting a foreigner in Syria is risky business: it’s not really legal.“I didn’t know it was dangerous,” Jamila told me over the phone. She signed up as a teenager, looking to meet people from abroad and practice her English. But she has never actually hosted a traveler; inviting a stranger into your home may be a typical act of Syrian hospitality, but letting them sleep there? Until the suburbs of Damascus were subdued, Jamila said military patrols would go door to door, demanding to see each household’s “family book”—a ledger of inhabitants registered with the state. Anyone not on the page, but inside the house, could be perceived as a draft dodger or a terrorist, which is to say a member of the opposition. So, instead of letting anyone surf her couch, Jamila has used the site as a social network, offering foreigners advice on what to see and do, and meeting up with them when they arrive.That can be dangerous too. Who are these people? Until recently, such visitors would be journalists who, if perceived as critical, would be subject to all the surveillance a police state can muster. And while paranoia has lessened somewhat, there are stories Jamila shared about such encounters that cannot be published without risking her liberty, even with the relative freedom of anonymity.You needn’t do anything wrong to end up in trouble with the Syrian authorities. Someone further up in the hierarchy of power could decide to haul you in for an interrogation, because that foreigner you spoke to could be perceived as a spy, or a journalist, or they just might need someone to blame for a screw up—someone being allowed into the country that shouldn’t have been, sometimes just in hindsight—who isn’t further up than them.Tour operators can’t take any chances; running afoul of the state could mean, at best, no more visas for your customers. For that reason they can’t just rely on the government’s background check when considering whether to admit a traveler; they scour social media, from LinkedIn to Instagram, to ensure that Western influencer isn’t actually a Western journalist. “I Google the name,” said Ayoub, the Damascus tour operator, “because if I discover that you work with international organizations, or journalists—especially the journalists—and they have not discovered this in the Department of Immigration, when trouble happens I’m going to be responsible.”It’s happened before. All the tour operators I spoke to, and most of the tourists, were familiar with a story from late 2018, which changed everything—or at least made explicit who would be blamed for a heavy-handed police state doing what heavy-handed police states do. A young German tourist, in some tellings a “journalist,” was taking photos on the outskirts of Damascus. While it might be okay to take photos of some damage, and impossible not to encounter it on one’s journey, entire suburbs have been decimated during the course of the war—and access to them highly curtailed, for propaganda purposes. “I was the tourist who encountered significant problems, and thought an explanation was in order,” Felix Mechnig-Giordano, posted to the private Facebook group, Every Passport Stamp. “While walking around Damascus I came across one of the destroyed suburbs and asked a soldier if it was possible for me to enter,” he wrote. “While no one was concerned at first, this ended up with me being blindfolded, handcuffed and thrown into a secret police van.” He spent the next five days in a military prison at the Mezze military base, where leaked photos from a regime defector show that thousands have been executed since 2011, just a few miles from bars and restaurants.“At some point, someone had accused me of being a spy,” Mechnig-Giordano wrote. The interrogation soon revealed that to be untrue, but that is not what saved him: his nationality did. “[I]t demonstrated how vulnerable foreign visitors remain to arbitrary detention, and that at basically any opportunity anyone can accuse [anyone] of pretty much anything, leading to arrest and worst.” And, he continued, “While my German passport protected me from any sort of physical harm, the same could not be said for the hundreds of Syrians I saw being held and tortured. As the secret police so loved reminding me, you are pretty much screwed and at their mercy with no possibility of consular assistance once you are detained.”His travel agent fled the country, which didn’t help appearances. After that incident, an unspoken rule became an explicit requirement that all Western tourists—shorthand for about everyone outside Syria’s immediate neighbors—be accompanied by a guide at all times. These are not government agents, but they serve a purpose: keeping an eye on the guests and steering them and their interlocutors away from the problematic.But the sanitized version of Syria on display in some content is not the product of state censorship nor of malice on the creator’s part. It’s the form; these are vacation highlights, accenting the virtues of a destination and its people. And there is an argument for not letting 18 million people be defined solely by their relationship to a hereditary war criminal.“When we hear ‘Syria,’ we tend to think of all the negative things we’ve been hearing in the news, on TV,” Stefan Gentsch says in one of his YouTube videos. A 33-year-old travel blogger who resides in Singapore, he visited Damascus for the first time in late 2018, his visa sponsored by an old friend. His experience, as presented online, is a rejoinder of sorts—to the idea that Syria is defined only by its war and its dictator. His videos showcase the Syrian people’s legendary hospitality (most people think he’s Russian), and in one he travels outside Damascus to a town called Maaraba, which is unlikely to be on anyone else’s itinerary. There he tours a bread factory and gets invited to a wedding where he is peer-pressured into dancing.“Being in Syria, being at this wedding, I witnessed something that even before my trip, I might not have imagined Syria to be like. People dancing and enjoying themselves… It’s such a contrast to what think of as Syria.”He had a good time, and there’s a powerful argument that human beings should not be divided by borders, or cede the inalienable right to cultural exchange because crossing a line on a map might be perceived as a political act.But it’s what Stefan told me over the phone about his trip to Maaraba that I found most interesting: an omission, not the product of malice, that might have altered the viewer’s perception of Syria, and bolstered the latter’s infamy as a bastion of arbitrary oppression. He was detained—by police or the military he isn’t sure. “I did get in a little bit of trouble,” he told me. His Syrian friend, and visa sponsor, walked into a shop in Maraaba, a town, held by rebels until early 2018, where tour operators I asked said no tourist should be (“Tourists go to the touristic sites. Why are you going to empty places?” an alarmed al-Alamy said. “You are putting yourself in a bad position.”). As his friend was shopping, Stefan was on the street, snapping photos of nothing in particular, as tourists do. That’s when a man in uniform approached him speaking Arabic, a language he did not understand. Still, he got the gist. “He didn’t like that I had taken a picture.” And so the officer took him to a station, where was detained for a couple hours. “I was just sitting there, smiling,” he said. “I was not concerned about ending up in prison. My concern, or my biggest concern, was that maybe my phone will be confiscated and I would lose all the pictures I had taken on the trip.” While it was what led to his detention, &quot;there&#39;s nothing special about the photo, it&#39;s an ordinary photo on the street to Maaraba,&quot; said Gentsch.Stefan GentschThere is no video of the incident, which ended with a superior, upon concluding that he was not in fact a spy or a one-man ISIS splinter cell, saying he could take all the photos he wants (“You’re a tourist!”). Accordingly, it is not on YouTube, and the impression, thus, is one of a country not quite as totalitarian as it was in reality. It is not propaganda, by any means. Still, Stefan told me he’s noticed his content being exploited by partisans who comment on his videos. “They might say something like, ‘Oh, if a German tourist can go to Syria, then why do Syrian refugees have to be let into Europe?’” And supporters of the Syrian regime—there is some crossover—will say “Assad is the greatest, he made this beautiful country safe again.”There are Assad’s opponents, too. They’ll say, “How can you report about how beautiful your experience was in Damascus, when 100,000 people have died under Assad’s rule?” Stefan said. It is a question he thought about. “The conclusion that I always tend to reach whenever I think about is that I’m traveling as a tourist, I know I do, and I don’t have any political motivation,” he told me. “I’m simply there to walk onto the streets to talk to everyday people, and to see what life is like.” Some do, however, intend to challenge the prevailing narrative on Syria—not just by humanizing people typically relegated to the status of voiceless bystander, or by simply leaving out an unpleasant encounter. Some are more consciously political, even if they still lean more tourist than activist. “Sitting in Damascus, having a beer, you had jet flights flying over head, fighting in the suburbs,” said Christian Lindgren, a 31-year-old Norwegian who visited in 2017. “There were no tourists in the country whatsoever.” The next year, when he returned following the regime’s military conquest of the suburbs, “it was much, much calmer. Like being in a different country.”But it still has its rules, like any other. Christian noted what happened to Felix, whom he described as a friend he met through travel forums online. “Wrong place at the wrong time,” is how he described his friend’s detention. “When you go there, any war zone with a lot of military and police, there’s places you shouldn’t take pictures of. It’s that simple.”But you should still try to visit. “When you go there, you’ll never trust Western media again,” he insisted. Indeed, his blog on his latest trip insists “there’s far less destruction in Aleppo than what the media has been telling us.” And there is, despite the tight controls on where one can visit and what one can do there, a sort of freedom, if only perceived: “I was granted full access,” he maintained. “I was even allowed to visit a school that Desh (ISIS) and al Qaeda used as headquarters.” (ISIS and al Qaeda were bitter opponents, and the former did not have a significant presence in rebel-held Aleppo).When I asked how he could be so sure he was getting the straight news in one of the most dangerous countries to be a journalist, he told me a rule he’s picked up in his travels. “Go to a bar, have a few drinks with the locals, and you’ll really get an honest answer,” he said. “In any country in the world, it’s the same.” “I’ve gone to so many places that seemed dangerous, in the media,” Christian explained, “and I’ve gotten so much criticism for it. But none of those people that gave criticisms have been to those places.”* * *Sarah Hunaidi has been to Syria. She lived there until 2014; like millions of others, she was forced to flee her home over the crime of opposing state-sanctioned murder. She does not necessarily oppose others doing what she cannot—set foot in the place she called home—but she does think that with privilege comes certain responsibilities.“Touring Syria and meeting Syrian people and buying goods to benefit them is one thing,” Hunaidi told me, “and taking vlogs and video and ‘reporting’ about ‘the truth’ is another.” The main difference between an ethical tourist and, frankly, an asshole, is conscientiousness—being aware of where, exactly, you are. “By existing in a war zone, you are part of the war,” she told me. And one can’t avoid politics when your being there, while journalists and refugees cannot, as approving of your presence was itself a political decision by those who started that war.Shiyam Ghalyon is a Syrian-American who works for the War Resisters League, an anti-imperialist organization in New York City. Her sin, in the eyes of Damascus, is being too consistent—opposing war crimes in Syria, no matter the party that carried them out. That means, primarily, condemning the leading perpetrator of violence since 2011: the government that stamps the passports. And that means, in turn, accepting that she cannot step foot in any territory that government controls.“I do not have a blanket opposition to go to Syria, but I do think it should be a requirement to be very purposeful and intentional,” Ghalyon said. “In general, one should be thoughtful of how they move between local communities—but especially when the local communities are experiencing severe and systemic government brutality.”Many travelers are thoughtful (some a good deal more than others) and do express a conscious familiarity with where they are from, the privilege that affords them, and where they have been: a devastated country full of traumatized people who could go to jail, or worse, if they were to provide a complete stranger, from abroad, a truly authentic experience in Syria. Self-censorship is not an allegation, but a fact of life, awareness of which is the prerequisite sought by many in the Syrian diaspora.“I never brought up the subject of politics,” said Joan, the Spanish travel blogger. He has a business relationship with a local tour operator, to whom he refers prospective visitors; he isn’t naive when it comes to where he’s sending them, and why the people there may offer a gentler-than-mainstream take on the head of their police state. “Usually, most people would say that they like Bashar al-Assad,” Joan recounted, “but I mean, there’s a very simple reason: the people who don’t like him are either dead or they escaped from the country.”In fact, he told me, Syria is a bit like Spain—“when we were under military dictatorship, led by Franco,” who, like Bashar’s father, ruled until death, after killing tens of thousands. In Franco’s Spain as in Assad’s Syria, it would be wrong to confuse post-war resignation with anything more than a desire to return to something approaching normal.“I mean, regardless of whether he’s a murderer or not, he brought now stability to the country, right? It was a civil war going on. And he won. And now, finally, he’s rolling,” Joan said.* * *There’s a thin line between exposure and exploitation. Traveling to a war-torn nation and posting footage of the destruction could raise awareness, or it could be an exercise in showcasing the traveler’s superior empathy—crass, superficial and gross. It’s a delicate balance that some avoid by omitting the war altogether. By focusing on the positive amid the rubble, though, one runs the risk of the same offense: failing to capture the gravity of the situation. Is it actually more perverse to carry on as if nothing is wrong?Xavier Raychell Blancharde, a British-Polish college student who visited Syria as an 18-year-old, stressed that when I asked about the upcoming tour he’s arranging. For $1,300, tourists can accompany him on a January 2020 trip to Damascus, Maaloula, Krak de Chevaliers and Bosra al Sham, a Roman amphitheater recently re-opened to tourism. “I’ve been to Syria twice now,” he told me. “While we will certainly not attempt to hide the tragedy that has taken place in the country, we will also not specifically be heading to destroyed neighborhoods as a tourist group, for I personally find this extremely disrespectful and immoral. It is not ‘war tourism.’”In a video on a recent trip to coastal Latakia—which comes with the disclaimer that it “is NOT intended to be political”—he too compared the nation to Spain. But, again, it wasn’t political, at least not overtly. “The landscape is really similar, I think, to some places I’ve been to in southern Spain. And I think very few people would actually imagine that this is Syria…. People have a stereotyped image of the place, and this just completely breaks down that stereotype,” he said.That Syria has beautiful places cannot be denied. Focusing on that may be a travel blogger’s purview, but it is also no doubt a coup for the regime whenever natural beauty, and not human-wrought destruction, is the focus of a Westerner’s piece of content.Jamila, the Syrian Couchsurfer, said most visitors don’t try to get into matters of death and punishment. “They all know that we cannot speak a lot about politics. They would just maybe comment, ‘We didn’t know people loved your president.’ These would be the comments. But they wouldn’t ask too much.”That many in the Syrian diaspora object to tourists taking selfies in Damascus (with rubble or otherwise) is understandable, to her, but she welcomes these visitors, and is happy more than just reporters are showing up these days. “I understand them completely,” she said. “They think of tourists coming back as funding the government and they are against the government. They would say you’re helping the government kill the Syrian people.”Still, she argued, “most Syrians who live in Syria want tourists, and most people who don’t live in Syria don’t want tourists” At the very least, it’s good for the economy. “Our life is not even the minimum life,” she told me. “We are like really, really poor. Everyone here is really poor. Tourism would benefit people who are living here.” And, she said, “Whether we like it or not, the government did win.”But most of those Syrians outside the country couldn’t come back, even if they didn’t already object to foreigners touring their former home. Syrians who left the country are inherently suspect. Why would you go? And according to the Syrian Association for Citizens’ Dignity, two-thirds of those who have returned, to live if not to visit, say either they or a relative are wanted for arrest by the regime, which remains hungry for conscripts to fight in a country very much at war. Most, overwhelmingly, regret their decision to return. Others could not be asked: since coming back they have disappeared. It’s the insensitive traveler who Jamila wishes would avoid her country. “I think there’s a type where they see us Syrians as aliens, as just like their little research project,” she told me. She had one white guy in mind. “He treats our misery as an experience. He treats our war, and the things we’ve been going through, as a thrilling experience.” And this type also believes a holiday can be a fact-finding mission. In truth, “We cannot speak a lot about politics, and if we spoke we’re not going to say everything we’re thinking about, because we’re not free to say whatever we want.”So don’t do that, if you go. Don’t expect your eyes and ears will always receive the truth; sometimes the ground can obstruct the senses. And know one thing: whatever your troubles, you are the lucky, privileged one in every interaction. Maybe that, more than any expose beyond the paygrade of the amateur or uninitiated, is what any traveler to Syria has a responsibility to convey. If you go, in other words, speak the truths that might prevent you from ever going back. Syrians could relate to that.“Syria is safe for foreigners, 100 percent, and yes, come please and support us because we need every single penny,” Jamila told me. “But,” she stressed, “it is not safe for Syrians.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Photo: AP alt=US President Donald Trump might try to make a &quot;threatening and intimidating intervention&quot; in Meng Wanzhou&#39;s extradition trial if it were broadcast, the Huawei CFO&#39;s lawyers have argued. Photo: APBut Meng&#39;s lawyers and those for the Canadian attorney general who seek Meng&#39;s extradition on behalf of the US are united in opposition to the request. Their arguments were released on Tuesday.&quot;If the Respondent&#39;s [Meng&#39;s] extradition hearing is broadcast, this will only increase the public scrutiny she faces and the attention her matter receives from officials in the United States,&quot; Meng&#39;s lawyers said.Such a broadcast &quot;amplifies the risk that the President of the United States will once again intervene in the Respondent&#39;s case, or harbour resentments that are both threatening and intimidating,&quot; they added.That was a reference to US President Trump&#39;s previous comments, in which he suggested he might intervene in the case to help strike a trade deal with China.Meng&#39;s lawyers said he &quot;politicised and sensationalised these proceedings by making public statements to the effect that the Respondent is merely a bargaining chip in geopolitical relations between the world&#39;s two superpowers, the United States and Canada&quot;.Lawyers for Canada&#39;s attorney general said in a submission that they shared Meng&#39;s concerns that a broadcast risked &quot;distorting the proceedings and the serenity of the court process&quot;.&quot;The Attorney General of Canada acknowledges that there is significant interest in this matter, but that alone does not justify the request for live broadcasting of the proceedings,&quot; they said.Meng, the chief financial officer of telecoms giant Huawei and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at Vancouver&#39;s international airport on December 1 last year, at the US&#39; request, triggering outrage from Beijing.Her detention, which came amid the ongoing trade war with the US, has thrown China-Canada relations into turmoil. Canadian ambassador John McCallum was fired last January after he told journalists that he thought Meng had a strong case and listed arguments she might make to thwart extradition.Meng remains under partial house arrest in Vancouver after she was detained last year at the behest of American authorities.

Photo: APOne plank of Meng&#39;s case is the double criminality test. In a submission made on November 13 but only released on Thursday, her lawyers said the accusation of fraud against her would have represented no crime in Canada.Similar arguments have been sketched out in preliminary hearings.The US alleges that Meng lied to banking giant HSBC about Huawei&#39;s relationship with Iran-based affiliate Skycom, causing the bank to process transactions that it otherwise would have not, because of the risk of breaching US sanctions on Iran.But because Canada does not enforce sanctions on Iran, &quot;under Canadian law [Meng&#39;s alleged actions] caused no risk of deprivation in Canada&quot;.Meng&#39;s lawyers said they only accept the US&#39; claims about Meng&#39;s actions for the purpose of making the double criminality argument.&quot;[The] transactions processed by HSBC for Huawei were not illegal in Canada. The USA had unique sanctions laws against Iran that proscribed HSBC&#39;s transactions, but Canada did not,&quot; the lawyers said.The meeting with HSBC in which Meng discussed Skycom took place in Hong Kong. But had it occurred in Canada &quot;HSBC would not face any potential liability under Canadian sanctions law&quot;, her lawyers said.Meng&#39;s extradition case is currently scheduled to continue until October 2020. She remains in Vancouver where she is living in her C$13 million (US$9.7 million) home under guard. She is allowed to travel around the city while wearing a GPS monitor on her ankle, but must comply with a curfew, and she is banned from going near the city&#39;s airport.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

0,486,Conservatives Maintain Lead With One Poll Shows Race Tightening,"<p><a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/tories-lead-over-labour-narrows-173855621.html""><img src="""" width=""130"" height=""86"" alt=""Conservatives Maintain Lead With One Poll Shows Race Tightening"" align=""left"" title=""Conservatives Maintain Lead With One Poll Shows Race Tightening"" border=""0"" ></a>(Bloomberg) -- The ruling Conservative Party maintained its lead over Labour with two weeks until the election, although one poll showed the gap narrowed by more than half, signaling a possible hung parliament that would stymie efforts to end the Brexit standoff.With the vote on Dec. 12, a BMG Research poll for The Independent on Saturday showed support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson‘s Conservatives slipped 2 percentage points to 39%, while backing for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party jumped 5 points to 33%, the poll said. That 6-point lead is less than half the margin in BMG’s Nov. 21 survey.Click here for more on the U.K. election and current polls“The shifts we have witnessed in our headline voting intention figures take the Conservative lead from a likely majority into possible hung parliament territory,” Robert Struthers, BMG’s head of polling, told the Independent.A Savanta ComRes survey for The Sunday Telegraph put Conservatives at 43%, up 2 points since last week, and 10 points ahead of Labour, which fell 1 point to 33%. The Brexit Party dropped 1 point to 4%. The Liberal Democrats were unchanged at 13%.John Curtice, a polling and election analyst, said in the Telegraph that the findings suggested an “apparent erosion of the Conservative position may now have come to a halt.”The BMG poll is the first to show a significant narrowing of the Conservatives’ lead, which had held in double digits for weeks. It contradicts one of the mostly closely watched surveys of the campaign, a YouGov study released last week using a technique that more closely predicted the surprise 2017 election result. That survey showed the Conservatives would win a 68-seat majority in Parliament in the upcoming vote.Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior adviser who was instrumental in the success of 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, in a blog last week warned the Tories not to be complacent and said there was a “very real possibility” of a hung Parliament.The new BMG poll, which surveyed 1,663 voters Nov. 26-27, also shows a 5-point drop in support for Liberal Democrats, to 13%, while the Brexit Party gained 1 point to 4%. The Greens were unchanged at 5%. ComRes did an online survey Nov. 27-28 among 2,025 people.The poll indicates no political fallout from Corbyn’s widely criticized BBC interview on Nov. 26, where he avoided apologizing for incidents of antisemitism linked to the party. The questions from the BBC came in response to a scathing editorial by the U.K.’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, in which he wrote that Corbyn’s pledges that the party was confronting antisemitism amounted to a “a mendacious fiction” and that he was unfit to lead the U.K.The dust-up distracted Corbyn and Labour from focusing on pledges to overhaul the U.K. economy and expand investment in the health care system that had begun to resonate with voters. He plans to speak about the public health at a rally in Leeds on Saturday and deliver a major speech on foreign policy on Sunday.The BMG poll was conducted before the Nov. 29 terror attack in London that prompted both men to temporarily suspend campaigning, and will likely make security and responding to terror threats a central theme ahead of the election.To contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Davis in London at abdavis@bloomberg.net;Giulia Camillo in New York at gcamillo@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giulia Camillo at gcamillo@bloomberg.net, Steve Geimann, Linus ChuaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/tories-lead-over-labour-narrows-173855621.html,30/11/2019

2,488,Merkel’s Coalition Shaken to Core By Partner’s Choice of Leader,"<p><a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/merkel-partner-throws-coalition-doubt-180450744.html""><img src="""" width=""130"" height=""86"" alt=""Merkel’s Coalition Shaken to Core By Partner’s Choice of Leader"" align=""left"" title=""Merkel’s Coalition Shaken to Core By Partner’s Choice of Leader"" border=""0"" ></a>(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s Social Democrats threw Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government into doubt by electing new leaders who have threatened to pull out of her coalition.SPD members chose a pair of government critics, 67-year-old Norbert Walter-Borjans and lawmaker Saskia Esken, 58, to lead their party instead of a pro-Merkel ticket led by her finance minister, Olaf Scholz. The result may signal the party’s willingness to pull out of Germany’s grand coalition after years of paying the political costs for keeping the chancellor in office.In his victory speech on Saturday evening, Walter-Borjans insisted he’d rather improve the coalition than pull it down. But he demanded Merkel review her cherished balanced-budget policy to ramp up investment on tackling climate change and on supporting poorer Germans as a condition of his support. Party delegates will vote next weekend on whether to stay in government when they gather for their annual convention.“I never said we need to leave,” Walter-Borjans said after the results of the election were announced on Saturday evening. “We must improve the policies and perhaps loosen the black zero,” he said -- a reference to Merkel’s budget pledge.The result pushes 65-year-old Merkel a step closer to the exit after 14 years in power and leaves Europe’s biggest economy approaching a crossroads. Growth is faltering and populism is on the rise while Merkel has found herself overshadowed by the hyperactive French President Emmanuel Macron and caught between a hostile U.S. and an increasingly assertive China.The decision signals a prolonged phase of political uncertainty in Germany that could hamper the European Union’s efforts to chart a path forward after Brexit and to wield its influence on the global stage.Merkel is due to meet Macron, Donald Trump and other NATO leaders in London next week to confront Turkey over its offensive in Syria and after that she’s due to sit down with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Paris to talk about ending the violence in Ukraine.Scholz is supposed to be in Brussels on Wednesday to broker a plan to complete the European banking union. In Berlin’s political establishment on Saturday questions were asked as to whether he will stay on as finance minister after losing out by 53% to 48%.After a tumultuous year in which the SPD and Merkel’s Christian Democrats both faced intense power struggles and the economy flirted with recession, Germany’s political and business elites had hoped for a period of calm and continuity. Indeed, Merkel this week had made an unusual plea to see the alliance through to 2021, saying there was still much to be done.But Walter-Borjans managed to tap the dissatisfaction of many Social Democrats who say their party has abandoned its working-class origins and should leave an alliance with conservatives.BreakupAny breakup may become a drawn out process. In addition to a straight vote on leaving the coalition there will be proposals at the convention setting out conditions for staying, potentially paving the way for prolonged negotiations.Merkel’s CDU said on Saturday that it still expects the SPD to honor last year’s coalition agreement. CDU Leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told delegates at its convention in Leipzig last week that she would refuse to renegotiate the coalition agreement that the two factions completed in March 2018.The SPD leadership will also have to weigh the merits of facing a possible snap election when they’ve slipped to around 14% in the polls. The party is running neck-and-neck with the far-right Alternative for Germany which elected a new co-chair at its own convention in Braunschweig on Saturday.Tino Chrupalla, a 44-year-old tradesman from the former communist East -- where the anti-establishment party enjoys strong support -- gives the group a fresh face. Chrupalla enjoys support of the party’s extreme-right wing but took a moderate tone, saying the party didn’t need “drastic language” to win conservative voters who feel abandoned by Merkel’s bloc.&#92;--With assistance from Tony Czuczka, Chris Reiter and Arne Delfs.To contact the reporter on this story: Birgit Jennen in Berlin at bjennen1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Raymond ColittFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/merkel-partner-throws-coalition-doubt-180450744.html,30/11/2019

Members of the Social Democrats, Germany’s oldest party, caused a political earthquake by electing a new Leftist leadership duo who have threatened to collapse the government. The shock election result will see Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, relative political novices, take power. Olaf Scholz, the current acting leader and Mrs Merkel&#39;s finance minister was defeated with his running mate Klara Geywitz. The final result of 53 percent to 45 percent in the poll of 425,00 party members proved a smack in the face for Mr Scholz, a centrist who has made much of his working relationship with Mrs Merkel. Given that almost the entire Bundestag faction backed Mr Scholz, the result also raises questions about how the winning duo plan to work with hostile MPs. The result is a blow for Merkel, who is serving her last term Credit: ODD ANDERSEN/AFP Ms Esken and Mr Walter-Borjans made clear during hustings that they are not prepared to remain in a coalition with the veteran Chancellor unless her party accede to a series of high-stakes demands, including extra billions in spending on infrastructure and a hike in the minimum wage. The choice of whether to negotiate or not lies outside Ms Merkel’s hands. After handing over the party leadership to her protege Annagrete Kramp-Karrenbauer last year, her future rests on whether the younger woman is prepared to talk, something she has shown no intention of doing. Already walking a tightrope between compromising with centre-left policies and placating their restive base, the CDU have little room for manoeuvre. In recent days Ms Kramp-Karrenabuer warned the coalition deal would “certainly not be renegotiated.” The SPD’s new leadership still needs to be confirmed by delegates at party conference next weekend, where they will also flesh out demands for the future coalition with the CDU. If no agreement can be reached the CDU will have to decide whether to continue as a minority government or call fresh elections. Ms Merkel has made clear she will not run again at the next election. With both parties slumping in the polls, pundits speculate that neither side is relishing the prospect of early elections. Speaking after the result, Mr Walter-Borjans emphasised that the task ahead of them was to reach out to moderates, saying “this is not about winning or losing. Our common task is to bring this great party together.”   Wounded by an election rout in 2017, the SPD had initially sought to go into opposition, but allowed itself reluctantly to be coaxed into renewing an alliance with Mrs Merkel. Many within the party however remained wary of continuing to govern in Mrs Merkel&#39;s shadow, and the coalition has lurched from crisis to crisis. The SPD has also been battered by a series of regional and European election setbacks this year. The leadership race was triggered by the departure of the party&#39;s previous leader, Andrea Nahles, after the party&#39;s poor showing in European Parliament elections.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/future-merkels-government-shock-victory-180024569.html,30/11/2019

Mahdi, who’s backed by neighboring power Iran, had offered to quit earlier but then insisted he’d only go once lawmakers agreed on a replacement.On Friday, the prime minister said that once he departs, parliament can “review its options and act to preserve the interests of Iraq.” The alternative could be a “vortex of violence, chaos and destruction,” he said.His move followed a call from an influential Shiite cleric for lawmakers to promptly hold “free and honest” elections to prevent the OPEC member from slipping into deeper chaos.Sheikh Ahmed Al-Safi, who speaks on behalf of Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, also renewed calls for officials to end the violent crackdown against protesters a day after security forces killed at least 25 people and wounded scores more in the southern city of Nassiriya, and demonstrators burned Iran’s consulate in the holy city of Najaf.Iraq will “pay dearly” for any delay by parliament in holding elections that “express the people’s will,” Al-Safi said in a Friday sermon.At least 380 people have died in clashes between security forces and protesters since Oct. 1, Ali Al-Bayyati, a member of Iraq’s independent High Human Rights Commission, said in a text message.Violence Against Iraqi Protesters Is Rising, Rights Group SaysIraqis, mostly from the Shiite majority population, are protesting against government corruption, poor services, and wide-ranging Iranian political influence, calling for an overhaul of the ruling class.To contact the reporters on this story: Khalid Al-Ansary in Baghdad at kalansary@bloomberg.net;Souhail Karam in Rabat at skaram10@bloomberg.net;Nadeem Hamid in Washington at nhamid3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.net, Andrew Davis, James AmottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/iraqi-premier-calls-parliament-accept-164516602.html,30/11/2019

The new drug, called Quadrimune, comes in strawberry-flavored granules the size of grains of sugar that can be mixed with milk or sprinkled on baby cereal. Experts said it could save the lives of thousands of children each year.&quot;This is excellent news for all children living with HIV,&quot; said Winnie Byanyima, the new executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency in charge of the fight against the disease. &quot;We have been eagerly waiting for child-friendly medicines that are easy to use and good to taste.&quot;Cipla revolutionized the provision of AIDS drugs for adults almost two decades ago, pricing them at $1 a day. The new pediatric formulation will likewise be priced at $1 a day. The announcement by Cipla and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, an offshoot of Doctors Without Borders that supported the development of the drug, was timed to coincide with World AIDS Day, which is Sunday.Despite big advances in the prevention of mother-child transmission of HIV, about 160,000 children are still born infected each year, according to UNAIDS, mostly in the poorest towns and villages of Africa. Almost half of them die before age 2, usually because they have no access to drugs or cannot tolerate them.Quadrimune is still under review by the Food and Drug Administration, and FDA approval almost inevitably leads to rapid certification by the World Health Organization. The company hopes to get a decision by May.Trials in healthy adults showed that the new formulation gets the drugs into the blood; the four drugs in it were approved in the 1990s and are used in many combinations.A clinical trial in HIV-infected infants, run by Epicentre, the research arm of Doctors Without Borders, is now underway in Uganda to prove to African health ministries that children accept the new formulation. Most of the research costs have been paid by UNITAID, a Geneva-based organization set up by​ France, Norway, Brazil and some other countries ​which imposed special taxes on airline flights that are dedicated to ​bettering​ global health.Currently, the most common pediatric drug combination includes a syrup that is 40% alcohol, has a bitter metallic taste that lingers for hours and must be transported in cold trucks and then kept in a refrigerator -- something that many poor rural families do not own.&quot;Some families try to bury it in wet sand or dirt to keep it cool,&quot; said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, executive director of the neglected diseases initiative. &quot;And the children are vomiting it on a regular basis.&quot;Moreover, each drug must be squirted into a child&#39;s mouth with a separate syringe, so a mother must have up to four syringes on hand and clean them for each subsequent use. Children generally have to take the medicines twice a day for the first four years of life. When liquid versions are unavailable, some pills cannot be crushed and mixed in juice; they must be swallowed whole.In contrast, Quadrimune contains four HIV drugs: ritonavir, lopinavir, abacavir and lamivudine. The granules are coated first in a polymer that does not melt until it reaches the stomach, and then with sweet, fruity flavoring.Dr. Kogie Naidoo, who heads treatment research at Caprisa, an AIDS treatment and research group based in Durban, South Africa, who was not involved in Quadrimune&#39;s development, said the new formulation could solve many problems she and her colleagues encounter while treating children.Cipla, founded in 1935, was the first generic drug company to offer HIV drugs in Africa. In 2001, its chairman, Yusuf K. Hamied, upended the global pharmaceutical industry by offering to supply a three-drug combination to Doctors Without Borders for $1 a day.At the time, multinational drug companies were charging up to $15,000 for their regimens and refusing to lower prices except in secret negotiations with a few countries and were working to block generic competitors from the market. An estimated 25 million Africans were then infected and thousands were dying every day. (The industry was also suing South Africa&#39;s president, Nelson Mandela, over a law he had signed authorizing the government to cancel drug patents and award them to generic-makers.)In 2001, Hamied said he was losing money at the $350 a year price; his break-even point was $600, he said, and he offered it to other buyers for that.But he said he acceded to requests from AIDS activists for the $1 a day price to deliver a shock to his Western competitors and because such a nice round figure was likely to make headlines (a gambit he is clearly repeating now).In the decades since, increased generic competition has driven the price of triple therapy in poor countries to below $100 a year.&quot;Over the past 20 years, Cipla has pioneered fixed-dose combinations for children and I do believe our Quadrimune could be a winner,&quot; Hamied said in an interview this week.Because all four drugs in the formulation are older and no longer patented, Cipla might eventually offer it in wealthy countries too, he said. But that market is quite small because most pregnant women in the West are tested for HIV and immediately put on antiretroviral drugs, which reduces to near zero the chances that they will infect their babies in the womb, during birth or through breastfeeding.The $1 a day price is for Quadrimune doses appropriate for children of between 20 and 30 pounds, he noted, so the cost for newborns would be even lower.Paradoxically, treating infants with HIV has actually become harder in recent years than it was two decades ago.In the early 2000s, Cipla produced Triomune Baby and Triomune Junior, two pediatric formulations of the world&#39;s first adult three-in-one pill, introduced in 2001.But they contained nevirapine, a drug that in those days was often given to pregnant women to prevent mother-child transmission. As a result, many babies were born with nevirapine-resistant forms of the virus, and the efficacy of pediatric Triomune fell by about half, Pecoul said.Some nevirapine substitutes that work in adults do not work well in children and the combination that does work has the bitter taste.Nowadays, many pediatric HIV specialists are frustrated that they cannot prescribe some of the newest drugs, such as tenofovir and dolutegravir, because there is little or no data on how safe they are in small children. The major drugmakers have little incentive to test their products in children because there are so few customers who can pay high prices.If a child&#39;s virus develops resistance to any regimen, a new one must be tried, so more research is needed, said Naidoo, the AIDS researcher in Durban.But by any measure, she said, Cipla&#39;s new, gentler formulation for children is a major advance: &quot;This is indeed great news for treating pediatric HIV.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/strawberry-flavored-hiv-drugs-babies-151901140.html,30/11/2019

Police believe that Usman Khan, who is affiliated with an al-Qaida-inspired terrorist group, acted alone in the attack, which is considered a terrorist incident. Khan was shot dead by police after civilians restrained him. Khan was reportedly wearing a GPS police tag and was out on parole. Police are now investigating how he was able to launch the attack despite authorities monitoring his movements. Police confirmed that, prior to the attack, Khan was attending a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation. [BBC, The Guardian] 2.President Trump has until Dec. 6 to alert the House Judiciary Committee if his counsel intends to call witnesses and introduce evidence in the committee&#39;s upcoming impeachment hearings as the inquiry transitions away from the House Intelligence Committee to the judiciary panel. Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) set the deadline in a letter sent to the president Friday. Nadler also set the same deadline for Republican lawmakers on the Democrat-led committee to let him know about any intended witnesses and evidence they wish to involve in the hearings. The lawmakers will then have a meeting on Dec. 9. Trump has also been invited to attend the committee&#39;s initial hearing scheduled for Dec. 4. He must decide by Sunday evening if he will accept. It is unclear how Trump or his counsel will respond to either request. [Reuters, The Washington Post] 3.Neither the Taliban nor the Afghan government indicated the sides were close to a cease-fire agreement, despite President Trump&#39;s assertion while visiting U.S. troops in Afghanistan for Thanksgiving on Thursday that the Taliban was ready to strike a deal. &quot;We are ready to talk, but we have the same stance to resume the talks from where it was suspended,&quot; the Taliban said in a statement in response to Trump&#39;s announcement. Talks between Washington and the Taliban sputtered in September without any formal conclusion. Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Afghanistan&#39;s President Ashraf Ghani, said &quot;it is too early to comment on any changes or any perceived changes&quot; in negotiations. [The Washington Post, The New York Times] 4.Danielle Stella, a Republican challenging Rep. Ilhan (D-Minn.) for her Congressional seat, had her Twitter account permanently suspended for repeatedly violating the social media platform&#39;s rules, a Twitter spokesperson said. Most notably, Stella wrote Tuesday that Omar should be tried for treason and &quot;hanged&quot; if a baseless claim that the congresswoman passed sensitive information to Iran was proven to be true. She reportedly later added a link to a blog post that included a drawing of a stick figure being hanged. Omar said Stella&#39;s tweets are the &quot;natural results of a political environment where anti-Muslim dogwhistles and dehumanization are normalized by an entire political party and its media outlets.&quot; [CNN, Fox News] 5.About 1,000 secondary school students and senior citizens joined together for a peaceful march Saturday in Hong Kong as part of the city&#39;s pro-democracy, anti-government movement. It was the first of several rallies planned for the weekend, as protesters continue to push back against what they consider to be police brutality and unlawful arrests. The demonstration was reportedly organized to show that Hong Kong&#39;s demands for freedom and democracy are cross-generational. Police authorized the march, which took place a week after the pro-democracy movement dominated the polls in Sunday&#39;s elections, taking 17 of the city&#39;s 18 district councils. One student said it was &quot;inspiring to see that we are all striving for the same ideologies&quot; despite the age gap. [The South China Morning Post, Reuters] 6.Two 15-year-old girls and a 13-year-old boy were injured Friday by a male suspect in a stabbing attack Friday in the Dutch city, The Hague. The victims have since been released from the hospital. The attack took place in the city&#39;s main market square while shoppers were out during Black Friday, which led to unusually large crowds. Police are still hunting for the suspect, and the motive remains unclear. An earlier description of the suspect was later rendered incorrect. Police have asked for patience and said that the complexity of the case means it will take time. [BBC, Deutsche Welle] 7.The initial public offering from Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco has drawn total bids of $44.3 billion so far from retail and institutional investors, about 1.7 times the amount the kingdom plans to reel in. The sale is on pace to be the world&#39;s largest listing when it formally prices next week. Most of the bids came from Saudi investors, however, hinting that international investors are wary about the state-owned company&#39;s valuation of $1.6 to $1.7 trillion set by the government. The Saudi government is aiming to sell a 1.5 percent stake and raise $25.6 billion, which would beat out Alibaba&#39;s $25 billion IPO in 2014. The IPO is a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s plan to diversify the Saudi economy. [Al Jazeera, The Wall Street Journal] 8.Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on Friday announced his resignation following Wednesday&#39;s firebombing of the Iranian consulate in Najaf and weeks of antigovernment protests that have left hundreds dead. In a statement, Mahdi said that his decision would allow Iraq to &quot;preserve the blood of its people, and avoid slipping into a cycle of violence, chaos, and devastation,&quot; although his successor has not been named. At least 400 protesters have been killed since the beginning of October, with 40 shot dead by security forces in three cities Thursday and early Friday. [The New York Times] 9.A massive winter storm that has already prompted warnings from Arizona to Wisconsin will be lumbering east in coming days, almost certainly interfering with Thanksgiving return-travel plans for millions. By the time it&#39;s finished, the storm, created by the same conditions that caused the &quot;bomb cyclone&quot; in California and Arizona earlier in the week, could pummel an area stretching from the Sierra Nevadas to New England — where a nor&#39;easter is predicted to begin on Sunday night. [The Washington Post] 10.Arizona Cardinals cornerback Josh Shaw received an indefinite suspension from the NFL that will at least last through the 2020 season for betting on NFL games multiple times this season. Shaw has not played for the Cardinals this season after landing on injured reserve in August following a shoulder injury. As a result, he reportedly hasn&#39;t been around the team very much during the season. The league did not find that Shaw used any inside information to bet on games or that any game was compromised. Shaw&#39;s teammates and coaches were also reportedly unaware of his gambling and were not involved. Betting on football is prohibited for anyone who works for the NFL in any capacity. Shaw is the first player to be suspended for gambling by the league in 36 years.

Here&#39;s everything you need to know:How did modern Ukraine emerge?  Ukraine&#39;s history is intertwined with Russia&#39;s. Both cultures descend from the medieval Slavic empire Kievan Rus, founded by Vikings in the 9th century with a capital where Kyiv stands today. After the empire was overrun by Mongol invaders in the 13th century, the Rus leadership moved northeastward, to a small trading outpost called Moscow. The lands around Kyiv were carved up by competing powers, who prized the fertile plains and rich, dark soil that later earned Ukraine the nickname &quot;the breadbasket of Europe.&quot; Poland and Lithuania dominated the country for hundreds of years, but by the end of the 18th century, the Russian Empire had taken the eastern lands, while the western were controlled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire -- a division that resonates to this day. Both empires collapsed at the end of World War I, and in 1917 a Ukrainian state was declared, but it was quickly swallowed by the communist Soviet Union. It was only in 1991, after the Soviet Union dissolved, that the modern borders of Ukraine were established. Russia has never really accepted Ukraine&#39;s independence, and Ukraine has been careening between pro-Western and pro-Russian leaders ever since.Why do Russians still see it as theirs?  The cultural and Orthodox religious ties between the two peoples go back centuries. But perhaps more importantly, Russia has no natural mountain or river borders to protect its western front, and it has long seen Ukraine as a vital strategic buffer. &quot;Russia without Ukraine is a country,&quot; explains Daniel Drezner, an international politics professor at Tufts University. &quot;Russia with Ukraine is an empire.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin wants at all costs to keep Ukraine out of the European Union and NATO, and he has used Ukraine&#39;s dependence on Russian natural gas as a weapon -- cutting off supplies in 2006 as Ukrainians froze in the winter cold. Ukraine is bitterly divided between Ukrainian speakers in the west, who mostly want to align their country with the West, and Russian speakers in the east.Why did the U.S. get involved?  Since 1991, the U.S. has sought to guarantee Ukraine&#39;s independence and security, seeing it as a key bridge between East and West. When the USSR dissolved, Ukraine inherited the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world, with some 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons pointed at the United States. Keen to avoid a proliferation of nuclear powers, the U.S., U.K., and Russia in 1994 signed the Budapest Memorandum, which transferred the weapons to Russia in exchange for a commitment by Washington, Moscow, and London to &quot;respect the independence and sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine&quot; and to &quot;refrain from the threat or use of force&quot; against it. Russia continued meddling in Ukrainian politics, though, and overtly broke the treaty in 2014.What did Russia do?  Ukraine&#39;s 2004 election was a showdown between pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko and pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. During the campaign, Yushchenko was disfigured by dioxin poisoning widely attributed to Russia, and after the vote was rigged for Yanukovych, Ukrainians rose up in the Orange Revolution, which culminated in a revote and a victory for Yushchenko. In the 2010 election, though, Yanukovych came roaring back to win the presidency with the help of both Russia and American political consultant Paul Manafort. In 2013, Moscow forced Yanukovych to cancel the country&#39;s bid to move closer to the EU, leading to an uprising that forced Yanukovych out. In the tumult that ensued, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and later sent troops into Ukraine&#39;s eastern regions to start a separatist war. The Obama administration punished Russia with sanctions, but chose not to send weapons to Ukraine out of fear of triggering a larger war.How is the war going?   Armed by Russia and supported by Russian paramilitaries, two ­Russian-­speaking Ukrain­ian regions collectively called the Donbass declared independence in 2014 and have been fighting with Ukraine ever since. An estimated 13,000 people have been killed and some 1.5 million displaced. In 2018, then-­national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other aides persuaded a reluctant Pres­i­dent Trump to send $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, including counter-artillery radar systems and Javelin anti-tank missiles. Without that aid, Mariya Omelicheva of the Pen­ta­gon&#39;s Nation­al De­fense Uni­ver­si­ty told The Atlan­tic, the 300-mile-long front line in the eastern Don­bass region &quot;would have been moved further west into Ukraine, and ­Russia-backed rebels would have controlled more Ukrain­ian territory.&quot; That&#39;s why the possibility of U.S. aid being held up -- the subject of the impeachment ­inquiry -- is so important to Ukraine. Ukraine&#39;s new president, Volody­myr Zelen­sky, finds himself caught in a struggle between Democrats and Trump -- who has reportedly been echoing Vladimir Putin&#39;s claim that Ukraine is corrupt and &quot;not a real country.&quot;Americans cash in  As Ukraine emerged from communism and struggled to build a rule-of-law economy, politically connected Amer­i­cans saw ways to make money. Paul Mana­fort, President Trump&#39;s former campaign manager, earned at least $13 million -- and possibly much more -- ­working for pro-­Russian Ukrainian oligarchs. His consultancy for a pro-Russian party that tried to undermine the U.S. alliance with Ukraine was crucial to the triumph of Yanu­ko­vych in the 2010 election. Mana­fort is now serving 7½ years in prison for tax fraud over those earnings. Joe Biden&#39;s son Hunter joined the board of Buris­ma, a Ukrain­ian gas company, in 2014 at a reported salary of tens of thousands of dollars a month, although there is no indication that either Biden broke any laws. Rudy Giu­li­ani, meanwhile, the president&#39;s personal lawyer, had a 2017 ­security-­consulting contract with the Ukrain­ian city of Kharkiv, and in 2018 he began working with two Soviet-born Amer­i­can executives, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Repub­li­can donors who wanted to sell gas to Ukraine. Federal prosecutors have indicted Par­nas and Fru­man for illegal campaign contributions and are now reportedly investigating whether Giu­li­ani &quot;stood to profit personally from a Ukrain­ian natural-gas business&quot; pushed by those two men.More stories from theweek.com  God&#39;s gift to America?  5 scathingly funny cartoons about the Trump-ified GOP  Democrats are running into Trump&#39;s economic buzzsaw<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/americas-troubled-alliance-ukraine-113502844.html,30/11/2019

Libya is a major waypoint for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East to Europe.  “The situation is very difficult, and we do not have the resources” because the center in Tripoli is at about twice its capacity, with some 1,200 migrants, Charlie Yaxley, a UNHCR spokesman, told The Associated Press.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/un-tries-cut-numbers-eu-104217388.html,30/11/2019

Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he didn’t agree that convicted terrorists always should serve out their full prison terms. He also accused governments of worsening the threat of such attacks and said the “war on terror has manifestly failed.”Must Read: The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionFor more on the election visit ELEC.Key Developments:Johnson pledges Conservative government will make sure convicted terrorists serve their full prison sentencesJohnson plans a review of Britain’s security, defense and foreign policyLabour narrows Tory lead in four of five new opinion pollsSecurity Minister Says Hung Parliament Disrupted Tory Terror Policy (11:19 a.m.)Security minister Brandon Lewis said the government would have already started the process of stopping the early release of convicted terrorists if it wasn’t for the U.K.’s hung parliament.Speaking on BBC Radio’s “Pienaar’s Politics,” Lewis said “we’d already started making steps in that direction” but that “one of the problems with parliament being utterly frozen over Brexit” is that this kind of legislation is unable to pass.The Conservative party won a majority in parliament in 2015, before losing it in 2017 and ruling in a minority government with support from the DUP. A number of resignations and expulsions over Brexit in 2019 further hampered the party’s ability to pass its legislation further.Johnson Refuses to Take Blame for Previous Tory Policies (9:55 a.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to distance himself from decisions made by previous Conservative governments as he appeared on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.When pushed on the record of the Tories on law and order and spending since 2010, Johnson repeatedly said he’s only been prime minister since the summer, and that previous governments had to implement “prudent” management of public finances.Johnson also said a government under him would invest more in the criminal justice system. He said about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early, and that they were now being “properly invigilated” in light of Friday’s attack.Umunna Says Terror Attack Shouldn’t Be Politicized (9:32 a.m.)Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna criticized the two main parties for turning the terrorist attack into a “political football,” saying instead the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats should all accept at least some blame for creating the current justice system because they have all been in government over the last two decades.Umunna, who quit Labour to join the Lib Dems this year, said the focus should be “on properly funding the parole board and the probation service.”Raab Says He Takes Nothing for Granted (9:25 a.m.)Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who may be facing a tight race to maintain his seat in Parliament, said he’s taking nothing for granted before the Dec. 12 vote.Speaking on Sky’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday,” Raab said the closeness of the polls in his constituency shows the risk of a hung Parliament, and that voting Conservative was the only way to avoid such an outcome.Former Adviser Says Ministers Ignored Warnings (8:50 a.m.)A prison expert said he warned in 2016 that the parole system couldn’t cope with terrorists, but the government ignored his findings.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ian Acheson, who was hired to advise ministers on the dangers of Islamic extremists in prisons, said he sent then-Justice Secretary Michael Gove a list of 69 recommendations, of which 68 were accepted. However, when the government’s report was published, under a new minister Liz Truss, it was weakened so only a fraction of the recommendations remained, including none of those about the probation service.Corbyn Declines to Say How He’d Vote in 2nd Referendum (8:40 a.m.)In the Sky interview, Corbyn avoided saying how he would vote in the second Brexit referendum that he’s promised if Labour wins the election.Corbyn also said the party apologized and regretted any antisemitism anyone’s suffered and that he wished “our party had acted on it more rapidly.” Earlier in the week, Corbyn had repeatedly declined to apologize to Jewish people for the behavior of some in his party.Corbyn Won’t Rule Out Early Release for Terrorists (8:30 a.m)Corbyn said convicted terrorists should not necessarily serve out their full prison terms and pledged to increase spending on the prison service. On Friday, a convicted terrorist who was released early from prison killed two people and injured three others in an attack near London Bridge. Usman Khan had been a guest at a conference on prisoner rehabilitation when he started attacking other delegates.“It depends on the circumstances; it depends on the sentence, but crucially it depends on what they’ve done in prison,” he said in an interview on Sky’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday.” He said he understood that the Parole Board was not involved in Khan’s early release and there was no probation service involvement in monitoring him.While Johnson pledged that a Conservative government would ensure convicted terrorists weren’t eligible for early release, Corbyn said he wanted to instead focus on increasing spending for the prison service and ensure anyone up for early release has a psychological assessment to see if they are a threat.“Our probation service was half privatized, is not up to scratch, is not able to deal with the number of cases they have to deal with and a lot of prisoners are simply put on a tag, or ex-prisoners rather, put on a tag which if they breach clearly the police are alerted.Corbyn Says Foreign Policy Has Worsened Terror Risk (Earlier)In a speech in York later Sunday, Corbyn will say the “war on terror has manifestly failed,” and that actions by governments have worsened the threat of attacks.The Labour leader will praise the response of police officers, and say they were right to use lethal force on Friday and say nothing can “absolve terrorists of blame for their murderous action,”. But he’ll also warn that for too long the U.K.’s “leaders have made the wrong calls on our security.”“The threat of terrorism cannot and should not be reduced to questions of foreign policy alone,” he will add, according to extracts released by the Labour Party. “But too often the actions of successive governments have fueled, not reduced that threat.”To contact the reporters on this story: Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.net;David Goodman in London at dgoodman28@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, James Amott, Helen RobertsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=""all"">",https://news.yahoo.com/corbyn-won-t-rule-early-083002524.html,1/12/2019

So why are so many people in the American military community today worried about the Army’s ability to deter conflicts with likely adversaries or prevail against those adversaries in future wars?The short answer is that warfare, always a mysterious amalgam of art, science, and guts, has become an increasingly complicated and unpredictable enterprise. America’s leading potential adversaries, China and Russia, have shown no small measure of imagination and dexterity in identifying the U.S. armed forces’ vulnerabilities, and exploiting them through the development of subtle yet aggressive geopolitical strategies, and increasingly lethal armed forces.Both “near peer competitors” may well be ahead of the U.S. military in applying newly emerging technologies—artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous systems, hypersonic weapons, and nanotechnology—to the ancient military problems of constricting an adversary’s maneuver, neutralizing its offensive weapons, and disrupting its command and control.These cutting-edge technologies, writes Christian Brose, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “will enable new battle networks of sensors and shooters to rapidly accelerate the process of detecting, targeting, and striking threats, what the military calls the ‘kill chain.’”Mattis: ‘No Enemy’ Has Done More Harm to Military Readiness Than CongressHow is it that “the most lethal land force in world history” finds itself in this unenviable position? While the Army exhausted itself fighting two frustrating and inconclusive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq over the last 19 years, both Russia and China embarked on grand strategies of regional hegemony designed to undermine the rules-based international order that emerged after World War II under American leadership. Both of these rising powers have developed myriad ways to sew discord and dissent in America’s network of alliances and to expand their spheres of influence.Beijing presents its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as the best path for underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa to gain access to modern infrastructure, capital, and prosperity. In practice, it’s plain that under the guise of building ports, roads, and communications infrastructure around the globe, China is engaged in predatory lending practices meant to gain political leverage and privileged access to foreign assets.In the South China Sea, Beijing has militarized seven hotly disputed islets, and is attempting to pinch the U.S. forces out of this strategically sensitive area entirely, even though international courts have declared China’s claims to these waters to be without foundation.Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has run rings around the Obama and Trump administrations in the chess game of international politics. He successfully annexed the Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine, and interfered in the presidential election of 2016 via “active measures,” i.e., information warfare aimed at creating confusion and conflict in the American body politic. Moscow also successfully intervened on behalf of the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and Russia is now a major player in the Middle East.As demonstrated in the Ukraine, the Russians are the master practitioners of “hybrid warfare,” in which conventional military operations—and the threat of such operations—are closely integrated with propaganda, proxy campaigns, cyber warfare, coercive diplomacy, and economic threats.Both Russia and China have revitalized creaky and obsolete military establishments into first-class warfighting organizations. The consensus among Western military analysts is that in their respective spheres of influence, both countries have sufficiently sophisticated “anti-access area denial” (A2AD) capabilities to inflict severe punishment on American forces attempting to penetrate those spheres in order to challenge aggression or come to the aid of an ally. According to Army General Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both Russia and China are “deploying capabilities to fight the United States through multiple levels of standoff in all domains—space, cyber, air, sea, and land. The military problem we face is defeating multiple levels of standoff… in order to maintain the coherence of our operations.”Gen. Milley and the rest of the Army’s top brass are well aware that their service is currently a rusty instrument for carrying out high intensity operations warfare against either potential adversary. The Army Strategy, an 11-page, single-spaced document published in October 2018, provides a rough blueprint for the service’s plan to transform itself from a counterinsurgency-oriented organization into the leading practitioner of high intensity war by 2028.It won’t be easy. The Army Strategy calls for truly sweeping, even revolutionary, changes in doctrine, training, and organization of forces.For the first time since the Cold War, the Army has to reconfigure itself to be able to fight and win in a contested environment, where it will not have undisputed control over the air and sea. At the same time, it must prepare to engage potential adversaries more or less continuously in “gray zone conflict.” General Joseph Votel, the recently retired head of Special Operations Command, succinctly defines this concept as “conflicts characterized by intense political, economic, informational, and military competition more fervent in nature than normal diplomacy, yet short of conventional war.”The Army Strategy describes four lines of effort to reach the service’s chief objective by 2028, in this order of priority: Readiness, modernization, department reform, and building alliances and partnerships. The last two lines are more or less pro forma in every American military strategy document I’ve read over the last 30 years: reduce waste and inefficiency, and work with allies to insure military interoperability. The first two lines are worth a close look, for they illuminate the broad contours of the service’s quest to regain its pre-eminence in great power conflict. The quest to enhance readiness begins with plans to increase the size of the regular army to over half a million men from its current level of 476,000. In a departure from recent practice, all units earmarked for contingency operations and overseas deployments will be fully manned and given state of the art equipment before deploying. In order to increase the size of the service, the quality and quantity of recruiters and instructors will be increased.The focus of Army unit training will shift from counterinsurgency operations to high intensity fighting, where the adversary is assumed to have cutting edge A2AD, offensive weapons, and cyber systems.Deployments of Army units around the world will be less predictable and more rapid that they’ve been to date, as the Army and the other armed services begin to put the “Dynamic Force Deployment” concept to work. This concept is closely associated with former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. It’s also classified, and few details have been released for public consumption. But the core idea, as Mattis explained in 2018, is for the U.S. military to “stop telegraphing its punches.” Combat forces and their support units will be moving in and out of potential flashpoint areas more frequently and at unpredictable intervals in order to proactively shape the strategic environment.Improving readiness also involves important upgrades in the Army’s defensive missile systems to counter China and Russia’s formidable A2AD systems. A new lower-tier air and missile defense sensor project will enhance the ability of Patriot missiles to identify and track targets at long range by 2022. Beginning in 2021, Stryker light armored vehicles will be equipped with a new air defense system to protect mechanized battalions and brigades as they maneuver in harm’s way.Missile system upgrades, coupled with an entirely new generation of combat vehicles, both manned and unmanned, will allow the Army of the future to penetrate adversary defenses with an acceptable degree of loss.Ensuring readiness to fight is the top priority of the Army until 2022. After that date, the service plans to turn close attention to implementing entirely new operational concepts and “technologically mature” systems that are currently in the research and development phase.The overarching goal is to be able to conduct sustained “multi-domain operations” against either potential adversary, and win, by 2028. In the modernization phase, the Army plans to introduce a host of new long-range precision weapons, including hypersonic missiles that travel at more than five times the speed of sound. An entirely new generation of combat vehicles and vertical lift aircraft, i.e., new helicopters and aircraft with capabilities similar to those of the V-22 Osprey, both manned and unmanned, are currently in the works.The new Army Network will be an integrated system of hardware, software, and infrastructure capable of withstanding formidable cyber assaults.The leading war-fighting concept at the foundation of the Army’s modernization effort, though, is clearly “multi-domain operations (MDO).” The first thing to be said about the concept is that it’s very much inchoate. Discussions with several active-duty Army officers suggest even those “in the know” about this classified concept have only a hazy idea of how such operations will work in the field, for the simple reason that many of the systems such operations hope to integrate are still in the early stages of development.The Army has only one experimental MDO unit on active duty. It is deployed in the Indo-Pacific Command and built around a conventional rocket and missile brigade. The brigade contains a unique battalion devoted to intelligence, information, cyber, electronic warfare and space operations (I2CEWS). According to Sydney J. Freedberg Jr., an editor at Breaking Defense, the I2CEWS battalion “appears to not only pull together data from outside sources—satellites, drones, spy planes—to inform friendly forces of threats and targets, it also wages war in cyberspace and across the electronic spectrum, hacking and jamming the sensors and networks that tell the enemy where to shoot.”The commander of Army forces in the Indo-Pacific, Gen. Robert Brown, recently told reporters that his experimental brigade has performed brilliantly “in at least ten war games” against what are presumably Chinese and Russian forces. Before the advent of the new unit, American forces repeatedly failed to penetrate either rivals’ anti-access area denial systems with acceptable casualties in war games. Another experimental brigade is expected to enter service in Europe soon.The U.S. Army has a long and unenviable history of being ill-prepared to fight the next war. The French and British had to train U.S. Army units before they were deployed in World War I. The Army entered World War II as the 17th largest army in the world, with underpowered tanks, airplanes, and ancient rifles. The Army that went to Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan had trained long and hard to engage in conventional operations against nation states, but was ill-prepared, psychologically or organizationally, for counter-insurgency war. The Army’s ability to adapt to new developments has long been hampered by infighting and excessive conservatism in the upper reaches of the service’s hierarchy.To remedy this problem, in July 2018 the Army created the Futures Command (AFC). Its purpose is to unify the service-wide modernization effort under a single command, and oversee the development of new doctrine, equipment, organization, and training. According to Gen. John Murray, its head, the AFC “will conduct war-fighting and technology experimentation together, producing innovative, field-informed war-fighting concepts and working prototypes of systems that have a low risk of… being rejected by future war fighters. There are no game-changing technologies. There are only game-changing combinations of war-fighting concepts, technologies and organizations.”To say that General Murray has his work cut out for him is a massive understatement. He surely has one of the most difficult and important assignments in modern military history. Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Late Saturday, a group of protesters blocked roads and set fire to a subway station entrance.Here’s the latest (all times local):Tear gas fired in Tsim Sha Tsui (5:45 p.m.)Police fired tear gas and used pepper spray as thousands of protesters marched in Hong Kong’s busy tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui. The police said in a statement that tear gas was fired in response to protesters throwing bricks at officers. March to U.S. consulate (Sunday, 1:30 p.m.)Thousands of protesters carrying U.S. flags and banners marched peacefully to the consulate. In a separate rally Sunday, demonstrators headed to Polytechnic University and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.China accuses UN Human Rights Head of meddling (late Saturday)China said it “strongly” opposed an op-ed by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, accusing her of meddling in the country’s affairs and emboldening Hong Kong protesters to commit violence.Bachelet urged the Hong Kong government to conduct a “proper independent and impartial judge-led investigation” into reports of excessive use of force by police, according to an opinion piece in the South China Morning Post on Saturday. She also urged Carrie Lam’s government to “prioritize a long-overdue process” of meaningful and inclusive dialogue with the people of Hong Kong.China said Bachelet and her office should “stop making irresponsible comments, and refrain from interfering by any means in the internal affairs” of Hong Kong.“The Central Government will continue to firmly support the Chief Executive in governing the Hong Kong SAR in accordance with law, support the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing law, and support the Hong Kong judicial organs in bringing violent criminals to justice according to law,” China’s UN mission in Geneva said in the statement.Tensions rise again (11 p.m.)About 200 protesters blocked roads, closed an exit at the Prince Edward MTR station and set fire to an entrance of Mong Kok MTR station late Saturday, the South China Morning Post reported. Police fired at least one round of tear gas, it said.Foreign nationals arrested in China (6 p.m.)China arrested two overseas nationals for their alleged involvement in the Hong Kong protest movement, state newspaper Southern Daily reported, citing information from the national security agency. Taiwan citizen Lee Meng-chu and Lee Henley Hu Xiang of Belize were arrested by the national security authorities in the southern Guangdong province, the local paper said.The Taiwanese was suspected of spying and leaking Chinese state secrets, while the other person was accused of funding criminal activities that endanger national security, the paper said. Prosecutors have approved the arrests in both cases and are going through legal procedures, it said.Protesters return (Saturday, 2 p.m.)Hundreds of secondary-school students and elderly people rallied in a park in the city center in support of Hong Kong’s ongoing protests and against police use of tear gas. A number of people addressed the crowd before a band played on a makeshift stage in front of background poster that said: The elderly and the young hold hands and we walk together with you.1,377 arrested in relation to PolyU (4:54 p.m.)Hong Kong police have arrested 1,377 people who left the then-besieged PolyU campus or were in the vicinity, the force’s Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen said at a daily briefing. More than 300 people under age 18 had their information taken down when they left the campus, he said, adding that he was “pleased” the episode at the school was coming to an end and that he hoped it could be a “turning point” for the city’s unrest, as it was resolved peacefullyPolice have now made 5,890 protest-related arrests since rallies began on June 9, he said.Hong Kong insurance sales to China slip (3:32 p.m.)Insurance sales in the financial hub to mainland customers declined in the third quarter as the protests halted visits to the city. Their purchases of insurance and related investment policies declined 18% to HK$9.7 billion ($1.2 billion) from a year earlier, according to figures from Hong Kong’s Insurance Authority. That year-on-year drop was the biggest since the start of last year, weighing on insurance giants such as Prudential Plc and AIA Group Ltd.Hong Kong is a hot market to buy insurance for mainland customers since it offers a wider array of investment products and access to foreign currencies. Since rules stipulate that customers need to finalize contracts in person, sales have been pummeled as many prospective Chinese customers have avoided the former British colony.PolyU siege ends (Friday 12:51 p.m.)Police said they lifted their blockade on PolyU after officers cleared the campus. Chow Yat-ming, the city’s assistant police commissioner, said he believed PolyU could be handed back to university management after dangerous items that remained on campus were removed.Firemen and a police safety team did a final sweep of the campus in the morning after searching every level of each building to handle hazardous items and collect evidence the day before.

But now they have become caricatures and cable news fodder—and their reputations are part of the professional carnage that comes to almost everyone who is part of the Donald Trump story. They are known to the American public primarily for the things they have said, for one reason or the other, about Trump—and even more to the point, for what he has said about them.Rudy Giuliani, James Comey, Robert Mueller, William Barr, James Kallstrom, and Louis Freeh have all taken divergent paths over the past few years. But in the more than two decades that preceded Trump’s descent down the golden escalator on election night 2016, their résumés overlapped as they worked to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice in such cases as Pan Am 103, a 747 blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland; the devastated Federal Building in Oklahoma City; the Khobar Towers full of American personnel, blown up in Saudi Arabia; the Atlanta Olympics bombing; the devastated American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya; the attack on the USS Cole at anchor in Yemen; then, of course 9/11. And it’s a sad fact that the work they did during their impressive law enforcement careers got lost in the noise created by Trump’s presidency.Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that for most of these men, what they thought of Trump in 2016 had a lot to do with their opinion of the occupants of the White House—Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton—during those years their lives had intersected. Those opinions proved to be enduring and consequential. * * *THE DIRECTOR* * *In September 1993, Federal Judge Louis J. Freeh walked out of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and into FBI Headquarters as its new Director. Both his youth, 43 years of age, and his background as a former FBI agent, made him an inspired choice to lead the Bureau when nominated by the new American President, Bill Clinton. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection viaGettyFreeh’s predecessor, William Sessions, had not completed his 10-year term as director before a report alleging ethical improprieties was released by President George H. W. Bush’s Attorney General William Barr (yes, the same William Barr who is today Trump’s Attorney General).Sessions refused to exit his position voluntarily, so it was left to Clinton’s new attorney general, Janet Reno, to fire him. Clinton may wish he had held on to Sessions. The new president and the new FBI Director would soon be at loggerheads. Although there was still a sense of excitement in Washington over the generational shift that the 1992 election represented, the fact was the Clinton administration began as an unmitigated disaster. It seemed undisciplined and chaotic to Freeh, and its early days were consumed with FBI investigations into Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Paula Jones and Jennifer Flowers, and even an investigation into China’s attempts to meddle in the 1992 elections. And, most mysteriously, there was the investigation into the shocking suicide of Bill and Hillary’s long-time friend from Arkansas, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. FBI agents walked around the halls dispirited, talking about their affection for George H.W. Bush and their disdain for the dirty campaign they felt the Clintons had waged against him. While Clinton came off cool (playing sax on The Arsenio Hall Show, for example), “The Wimp Factor” tagline stuck to George H.W. Bush—a man who had flown 50 combat missions during World War II, had been one of the Navy’s youngest aviators and was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Freeh, who had been appointed a federal judge by the senior Bush, had a deep affection for him. He accepted the job as FBI Director even though he believed not only that the wrong man had won the presidency, but was firmly convinced that the winner, Clinton, was dirty. In those years, the FBI’s antipathy towards the Clintons flowed from the top down—and would become ingrained in its organizational culture. For his part, had Clinton wanted an FBI Director who would do his bidding and sweep his scandals under the rug (which the current president seems to believe is part of the job description), he knew damn well it wouldn’t be Freeh. Yet, he courted Freeh. Freeh, considered tough and clean as a hound’s tooth, would give the new Clinton Administration a patina of ethical validity it desperately needed. But Freeh’s FBI was immediately immersed in investigating Clinton’s skeletons. Freeh gave back his White House pass that had allowed him unlimited, unrecorded, access to the White House believing it would pose a conflict of interest while the Clintons were under investigation. Clinton, now realizing Freeh would be breathing down his neck, was not happy with this slap in the face. But during his entire administration, and with the endless ethical clouds that hung over him, Clinton did not dare fire Freeh.Freeh and Clinton would not speak for four years, until the bombing of the USS Cole.* * *THE HILL* * *Freeh was an instant darling with Members of Congress, and was accorded great deference and latitude. He would need it. The FBI Freeh walked into had a plethora of problems and investigations of its own to contend with. His earnest demeanor served him well—and he was complemented by his equally earnest Congressional liaison chief, John Collingwood, who was spectacularly effective at putting out the FBI’s fires. Without a drop of arrogance and possessing a deep belief in the mission of the Bureau, Collingwood was also a master at turning every FBI screw-up into an opportunity—for more resources or more law enforcement authorities. He was perhaps the greatest asset the Bureau had when facing its many challenges with Congress. When I worked in his office, I learned from Collingwood a simple formula for dealing with the Hill that most federal agencies refused to learn: Congress can be your best friend if you don’t treat its members and staff like the enemy. Give them (most of) what they ask for, be personable and on a first-name basis with staffers, and give them a heads-up to important stories before they hit the media—even if its means calling them at home at 2 a.m. (which we often did). If trust is built, Congressional staffers will, in turn, give you a heads up to potential problematic or embarrassing issues that could otherwise blindside the Director at an oversight hearing. (The first rule of any good staff work, anywhere: never, ever allow your boss to be surprised by bad news.)Collingwood could wrap his arm around the shoulder of Senator Robert Byrd (the most powerful man in Congress at the time), and Byrd would feel the entire goodwill of the FBI in that gesture—especially after Byrd made it possible for the FBI to move its badly outdated Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) to Clarksburg, West Virginia, Byrd’s home state. The CJIS is the largest division of the FBI responsible for, among other things, its automated fingerprint identification lab and national instant criminal background check system. Byrd was known as “the king of pork” for his ability to shovel millions of dollars to West Virginia. The FBI was smart enough to seize on the opportunity Byrd was offering, thus giving him a stake in the sustainability of the FBI, as well as much needed jobs for West Virginians.And the FBI’s sustainability was not a given. Freeh took charge of an FBI still reeling from its role in the carnage that occurred at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas. Both locations had been the site of standoffs between citizens and federal agents, and Waco and Ruby Ridge had become rallying cries for anti-government militias. The overly aggressive actions of federal agents had left 83 Americans dead. The country’s faith in federal law enforcement was at an all-time low. Armed, anti-government militia groups were sprouting up across the nation. At the same time, far removed from Ruby Ridge and Waco, in lower Manhattan an even more insidious threat was about to make itself known. On Feb. 26, 1993, a rental truck carrying 1,400 pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded under the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Six people were killed in an attack right in the heart of America’s financial center.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had energized the jihadist movement around the world. After the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, mujahideen veterans and fellow-travelers seemed to replace their anti-Soviet fervor with an extreme anti-American ideology. Many began congregating in Islamic centers and mosques across the U.S., including New York and New Jersey. Although American military assistance had helped turn the tide for the mujahideen in their war against the Soviets, they now turned their sights toward the U.S. This was known as “blowback.” But blowback would not be coming just from Afghanistan’s jihadists. It was also developing in America’s heartland.* * *OKLAHOMA CITY* * *The security guard sitting outside the offices of the House Intelligence Committee stopped me and pointed to the television on his desk. On the screen was a horrific scene coming out of Oklahoma City. A building was sheared in half. Under tons of rubble lay an unknown number of bodies. A moon-like crater was obvious in the street where a Ryder rental truck had detonated 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate—a much bigger and more powerful bomb than the one used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.  Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Ralf-Finn Hestoft/CORBIS viaGettyWhen Timothy McVeigh was apprehended, the motive for the carnage became clear. The date of the slaughter was April 19, 1995, exactly two years after the federal standoff at David Koresh’s compound in Waco, Texas. This was McVeigh’s revenge—blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 children.The scale of the Oklahoma City attack, the very audacity of it, the very cruelty of it, committed by an American against other Americans, seemed like evil incarnate. Here was an “all-American white boy,” as people said, brutally killing fellow innocent Americans and children right in America’s heartland because of his hatred for federal agencies. If this level of anger existed out there in the country, how and where else might it express itself? Federal law enforcement and the media became obsessed and slightly hysterical over the idea of anti-government militias, even though McVeigh had no formal ties to any of them. Ultimately, however, McVeigh’s actions had an effect opposite to the one he intended. Instead of adding fuel to the anti-government movement, militia members resented the fact that the Feds would now be breathing down their necks. And they certainly were disgusted by the killing of so many innocent children. Some militia members began cooperating with the Feds, alerting them to possible violent extremists in their midsts. The FBI created a Domestic Terrorism Planning Section which found itself handling mostly threats against abortion clinics and crimes committed by radical animal rights groups, like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Without reasonable cause, there was little the FBI could do to surveil American citizens traipsing through the woods with legally owned firearms playing weekend warrior. They couldn’t be arrested simply for their views. But after Oklahoma City, the FBI drafted a wish list of expanded authorities to monitor potential terrorists domestically. A coalition of left and right civil libertarians on the Hill thwarted attempts to pass these measures. (Some of the expanded authorities gained new life after 9/11 when they became part of The Patriot Act.)Trump Is First to Use PATRIOT Act to Detain a Man Forever* * *THE SAUDI MIRROR* * *One again the terror spotlight was about to shift. On June 26, 1996, just weeks after the FBI had successfully concluded an 81-day standoff with the anti-government Freeman group in Montana, a truck bomb exploded in a housing complex in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Air Force personnel who were there to enforce the no-fly zone imposed on the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Hezbollah in the Hijaz (or “Saudi Hezbollah”) took credit for the attack. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyThe Saudis knew more than they let on to the FBI about this group, but getting information from the Saudis involved a very delicate diplomatic dance—something FBI agents abhor. The deference paid to the Saudis after Khobar would never be accorded to another country within whose borders American servicemen had been killed. Less than a year before the Khobar bombing, another bomb had exploded in Riyadh, killing five U.S. Defense Department contractors. But before the FBI could interrogate the suspects, the Saudis extracted confessions from them and had them beheaded. Now 19 American airmen had been killed in Saudi Arabia, and the United States was once again saying “pretty please” to Saudi royals to get them to share information. It’s hard to determine whether it was Freeh’s strained relationship with the Clinton administration, or the Clinton administration’s hope for a rapprochement with Iran that led to other roadblocks in the Khobar investigation. Iran was clearly behind Saudi Hezbollah, but it was the Saudis, and the Saudis alone, who held the key to the investigation. With the information they possessed on the attack the year before, Khobar might have been prevented.  To shake information loose from the Saudis, and with less than enthusiastic support from the Clinton Administration, Freeh turned again to his friend, former President George H.W. Bush, who had liberated Kuwait from Saddam’s occupation and guaranteed the security of Saudi Arabia four years earlier. Freeh also weighed in with his own pal, the flamboyant Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan.  As Lawrence Wright reported in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Looming Tower, John O’Neill, the chief of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Section, had angered Freeh (who valued his relationship with Bush, Prince Bandar, and his ability to gain access to Saudi Arabia without help from the Clinton White House) by telling him on a flight home from the Kingdom, “Boss, they’re blowing smoke up your ass.” The FBI did finally get access of sorts to the Khobar detainees held by the Saudis—but only by watching behind a two-way mirror as members of the Mabahith, the Saudi secret police, asked the questions. * * *PRECEDENTS* * *To understand how the Bureau developed its response to terrorist attacks you’d have to go back to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Pan Am 103 was the first major terrorist attack against American civilians. A Hezbollah bombing of the US Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon three years earlier had killed 220 Marines and 21 civilians. But Pan Am 103 was a watershed: 190 passengers had been American citizens on their way home for the Christmas holidays; 43 were British, and at least 19 other nationalities were represented among the lost. Among those killed were 35 students from Syracuse University returning to the U.S. after a semester studying in London. The U.N. Commissioner for Namibia, the CEO for Volkswagen America, the CIA’s Beirut Deputy Station Chief and a group of other U.S. Intelligence specialists were on that flight, raising suspicion that it might have been specially targeted. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Bryn Colton/GettyLegislation was passed giving the FBI extraterritorial jurisdiction over investigations wherever Americans were killed, and the Pan Am 103 investigation would be handled by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division—headed by one Robert S. Mueller—a recent Bush 41 appointee. Mueller had been overseeing the prosecution of Manuel Noriega and mob boss John Gotti, but Pan Am 103 had the greatest emotional impact on him. As recently as 2018, Mueller met once again with family members of that ill-fated flight, including the now-adult children of victims, telling them, “There are those who say that time heals all wounds. But you know that not to be true. At its best, time may dull the deepest wounds; it cannot make them disappear.”  Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Ron Sachs/Consolidated News Pictures/GettyOn Nov. 19, 1991, Acting Attorney General William Barr (yes, the same William Barr who is attorney general today), announced the indictments of two Libyan intelligence operatives for placing the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103. A trial would not begin until 2000. In 2003, Libya would pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the victims. The man found guilty, Abdelbasit Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, would ultimately die at home in Tripoli in 2017.But in 1988, never having dealt with a terrorist attack on the scale of Pan Am 103, the Bureau received very poor marks for its outreach to the grieving families. So when the Khobar Towers bombings occurred, Freeh would go out of his way to promise justice to the victims’ families—a justice that would, however, have to be finessed to suit Saudi sensibilities.In his 2005 memoir, My FBI, Freeh credits the ultimately successful indictments of the Khobar Tower suspects to his hand-picked choice as prosecutor, James B. Comey. (Yes, that James Comey.) “I will always be grateful for his leadership and pursuit of justice,” Freeh wrote of Comey, who was responsible for a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returning a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the bombing of the Khobar Towers.But the Bureau barely had time to catch its breath. Just three weeks after the Khobar Towers attack, the genuine, overwhelming desire by the FBI to convince grieving families they would receive justice would be tested in unimaginable ways. On July 17, 1996, TWA 800 exploded over the Atlantic shortly after taking off from JFK airport, killing 240 people.END OF PART ONETOMORROW: CONSPIRACIES AND DISASTERSRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

7,608,Johnson Seeks Change to Sentencing Rules After Terror Attack,"<p><a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/johnson-seeks-change-sentencing-rules-223000868.html""><img src="""" width=""130"" height=""86"" alt=""Johnson Seeks Change to Sentencing Rules After Terror Attack"" align=""left"" title=""Johnson Seeks Change to Sentencing Rules After Terror Attack"" border=""0"" ></a>(Bloomberg) -- A majority Conservative government will stop the automatic early release of people guilty of terror crimes, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, levering the fallout from Friday’s incident on London Bridge to make law and order one of the key issues before next month’s general election.The man who went on a stabbing rampage in the capital has been identified by police as Usman Khan, who was released from prison on parole in December 2018. He was one of nine people convicted in 2012 for offenses ranging from a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange to planning a terrorist training camp.Khan originally received an indeterminate sentence, which was changed on appeal in 2013 to 16 years. Johnson said he was sentenced under laws passed in 2008 that established automatic release. The Labour Party was in power at the time.“If you are convicted of a serious terrorist office, there should be a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years -- and some should never be released,” Johnson said in a statement Saturday. “Further, for all terrorism and extremist offenses the sentence announced by the judge must be the time actually services -- these criminals must serve every day of their sentence, with no exceptions.”With voters set to go to the polls on Dec. 12, the Conservatives are using the revelation that the attacker was a former convicted terrorist to emphasize what they consider one of their stronger cards -- crime prevention.Johnson, who has pushed for a tougher penal code for months, even indirectly linked Friday’s events to the fact that the latest Parliament blocked his minority administration’s attempts to drive through his Brexit deal.“Due to the broken hung parliament that was preoccupied with blocking Brexit, we could not do more,” he said. “We need a government that can act.”RehabilitationThe U.K.’s main opposition party said that convicted terrorists should not necessarily serve out their full prison terms if they change their ways.“I think it depends on the circumstances; it depends on the sentence, but crucially depends on what they’ve done in prison,” U.K. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said in an interview on “Sophy Ridge on Sunday” on the Sky network.“Prisons ought to be a place where people are put away because of major serious offenses, but also a place where rehabilitation takes place,” he said.(Updates with opposition comments starting in eighth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Andrew Davis and Mathew Carr.To contact the reporter on this story: James Ludden in New York at jludden@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Matthew G.

He was referring to an interview the French leader gave last month in which he not only criticized Turkey, but described the alliance as brain dead.With three significant member states bringing conflicting agendas to the table at a gathering that takes place in the closing stretch of a charged U.K. election campaign, the event risks fanning concern about NATO’s future, rather than celebrating what alliance officials and leaders routinely call the most successful military grouping in history.Officials from the U..S. and Britain were at pains last week to highlight NATO’s successes, including a renewed sense of purpose since Russia’s 2014 aggression in Ukraine. Defense spending is on the rise and NATO is expanding into counter-terrorism, cyber security, and now even space.And NATO does continue to attract. North Macedonia, set to join next year, will bring the number of leaders at the table this week to 30, up from 15 when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.Such accomplishments however are being drowned out by the increasingly public dispute over what NATO should focus on, and what it should stand for. In an apparent attempt to contain the debate, Germany has proposed forming an expert group to report on the future political shape of the alliance.Macron drove Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel to make an uncharacteristically spirited defense of the alliance last week. “Even more than during the Cold War, maintaining NATO is today in our own best interest,” she told lawmakers in Berlin. “Europe cannot currently defend itself alone.”Read more: Erdogan May Seek EU Money Even as He Trades Insults With MacronA senior U.S. official said on Friday that Trump would prioritize enlisting NATO to push back against China’s growing influence. The official said Trump would also press allies to increase defense spending and to exclude Chinese companies from the construction of 5G mobile networks, something many have been unwilling to do.Instead of containing China, Macron wants NATO to prioritize the fight against terrorism. Thirteen French soldiers died in Mali last week and a lone terrorist on Friday killed two people in London. A French official said Macron also plans to press for greater “operational” burden-sharing as a way of complementing Trump’s push for Europe to share more of the alliance’s financial burden.Erdogan, meanwhile, is demanding acceptance of Turkish goals in northern Syria, including classifying as a terrorist threat the Kurdish militias that have fought Islamic State alongside other NATO allies. He also rubbed salt into another open wound in Turkey’s ties with Western allies, by unpacking and testing the NATO non-compatible S-400 air defense system he recently bought from Russia.Read more: NATO Foresees More Europe Defense Outlays as It Braces for TrumpAnd that’s all before Trump makes his first tweet of the event.“It will be a great tribute to how much all the NATO allies value the institution if we manage to get through this leaders meeting without President Trump, President Macron or President Erdogan doing something damaging to the alliance,” said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council official in the George W.

Long term NATO watchers also caution against exaggerating the dangers of intra-alliance tensions, which aren’t new to an organization that includes countries with differing geographies and security priorities.Macron’s questioning of the collective defense commitment at NATO’s heart is certainly dangerous, but in many ways he is simply reverting to France’s traditionally semi-detached status. President Charles De Gaulle pulled out of the organization’s military command structure in 1966, and France rejoined only in 2009.Read more: Macron Says NATO Should Shift Its Focus Away From Russia“It’s not a fashionable view, I know,” said Sir Adam Thomson, the U.K.’s envoy to NATO from 2014-2016, but NATO “has been pursuing a new vision since the end of the Cold War and, to some extent, it’s already got a lot of the material.”He cited three new roles since the Cold War: Crisis management in places like Afghanistan, keeping a lid on potential disputes between members in eastern Europe, and building partnerships with dozens of non-member countries.“It is quite distinctive that this alliance, which in the eyes of some is so wicked, finds so many partners to work with it.”As the site of NATO’s first headquarters, London was a natural choice for this week’s anniversary.

Almost Everything."" border=""0"" ></a>Jane Sweeney/GettySEVASTOPOL, Crimea—The seductive voice of the late French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg played as background. “Je t’aime.. moi non plus.” And waiters in long white aprons drifted among the tables at the La Brasserie café. Looking at the exaggerated 19th century Parisian interior, nobody would have guessed Sevastopol’s tragic past and turbulent present. Several wars and conflicts have left this strategic Black Sea port in ashes, pushing waves of terrified people away from the sandy beaches and green hills of the Crimean peninsula as refugees and exiles. Today, almost five years after Russia took this land from Ukraine, one sees articles in the Western press starting to tout Crimea as a tourist destination, even as sanctions against Russia keep it isolated economically. Some residents say life in this city has come to seem “a parallel universe.”Trump at G7 Blames Everybody but Putin for Crimea AnnexationOur tourist guide, Alexander Kuts, a local expert in Crimean history, suggested we step outside of the café to see the main highlights along the embankment. War museums, memorials and monuments were all around us, a vivid map of strife that killed hundreds of thousands of people since the name of Crimea first became a byword for Great Power confrontation in the 1850s.The city of Sevastopol was founded by Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1783, the first time Crimea was taken over by Moscow. The French philosopher Voltaire, fascinated by Russia, wrote to Catherine that he saw Russia’s European destiny in the Black Sea region where it would push out Turkey, and he endorsed the “genius” of the empress who took control of Crimea as well as other regions along the Azov and Black Seas coasts. But its very importance made Crimea hard to hold on to. By the mid-1800s Turkey and Europe were pushing back.Alexander, our guide, pointed to a place in the bay where Admiral Pavel Nakhimov and other Russian navy commanders made the decision in September 1854 to scuttle seven of their own ships to block the entrance to the harbor. Only the masts remained above the water. The tactic stopped the British and French fleet approaching the city center, but the troops landed to the north virtually unopposed, then pushed southward in a long and horrifying campaign. After the battle of Inkerman, now a suburb of Sevastopol, British war correspondent William Howard Russell wrote to his wife about friends he had lost, “buried as they lay all bloody on the hillside amid their ferocious enemies, and I could not but exclaim in all bitterness of heart, ‘Cursed is he that delighteth in war.’” Russell wrote that he found it impossible to sleep in his tent that night “owing to the groans of dying Russian prisoners outside. They are as thick on the field as sparrows on a hayrick. They literally die in heaps, and they are buried 30 together in holes in the ground. The air stinks of blood.”In Leo Tolstoy’s “Tales of Sevastopol” he writes about the carnage of the Crimean War that he saw as a young officer in the Russian army. Tolstoy wondered at the extraordinary courage of the common soldiers risking their lives to  defend the city: “the kind of men who are capable of living calmly under a hail of shot and shell … in conditions of constant, toil, vigilance and filth. Men cannot endure such awful conditions for the sake of a Cross or a title, or under threat of punishment: some other, more exalted reason must prompt them. And this reason is a feeling that is rarely displayed, shyly hidden by the Russian, but nonetheless entrenched deep within each—love for the mother country.”The siege of Sevastopol (or Sebastopol, as the British and French spelled it) went on for almost a year before, finally, it fell. And yet, when the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, the French Empire, the Austrian Empire, Sardinia (the most powerful kingdom of Italy), and Prussia signed a peace agreement with the Russian Empire in Paris the following spring, Sevastopol was just another bargaining chip for the monarchs of Europe to trade on the map, and it went back to the tsar.On December 9 this year, there will be an echo of that history when world leaders sit down for one more peace agreement in Paris. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to try to decide the future of the war in Eastern Ukraine, or Donbas, that began in the spring of 2014 after pro-Russian President Victor Yanukovych was toppled and Russia unilaterally took Crimea away from Ukraine. According to Russia, taking Crimea was not an aggressive act of annexation, it was “reunification” with the motherland, which is one reason history weighs so heavily here, where the air once stank of Russian blood.* * *SHIFTING SOVEREIGNTY* * *In Soviet times, in 1954, Crimea was assigned to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, it kept the peninsula. Under an agreement brokered in part by the United States, Kyiv agreed to give up the many nuclear weapons left in its possession in exchange for guarantees that Russia would “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”  But that was in 1994. In 2014, Putin simply ignored the agreement and, after the annexation of Crimea he supported separatists in eastern Ukraine to give the government in Kyiv something else to worry about. So far, almost 14,000 people have been killed in the Donbas war. President Zelensky has lamented the fact that Crimea has never been part of the efforts to settle the Donbas conflict in the earlier Minsk accords or what are called “the Normandy format” talks, even though they are now held in Paris. He said recently he hopes that the upcoming round will offer “at least” the chance to bring Crimea back into the discussion. But in truth, as Putin certainly expected, much of the world is coming to accept Russia’s annexation of Crimea as irreversible, a fait accompli. The latest incremental appeasement of Moscow: Apple now shows Crimea as Russian territory on its map and weather apps—but only when viewed from Russia.More troubling for Kyiv and many of its supporters in the West, U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants to be friends with Putin and, we recently learned, really does not like Ukraine, seems to be leaving the door open to U.S. and international acceptance of Moscow’s dominion over Crimea. Russia was expelled from the G8 in 2014 as one of several measures, including economic sanctions, taken by Europe and the U.S. to punish the Kremlin for its aggression. In August this year, Trump argued Russia should be let back into the G8 club, suggesting the only reason it was expelled was because an “embarrassed” President Barack Obama was “outsmarted by Putin” when Crimea was “taken away from President Obama,” as if it had somehow belonged to the United States in the first place. * * *NAME CHANGES* * *Through the generations, Crimea’s heroes and its perspectives on their place in history have ebbed and flowed like the waves of the Black Sea. Three decades after the end of the Crimean War, the Russian Empire named a street after Admiral Nakhimov.  But 34 years after that, the Bolsheviks’ October Revolution destroyed the old Russian Empire and the street lost its name again.  Our guide pointed at Grafskaya Dock, another historical spot in Sevastopol. After years of fighting, the Reds had pushed Russian nobility and the White Army south to Crimea.  Almost a century ago, on a chilly, grim November morning in 1920, Russian General Petr Vrangel, the last commander of the White Army, arrived at Grafskaya Dock to inspect the ships with noble families waiting to flee from the Bolsheviks’ terror. The British and French military now helped to evacuate more than 150,000 Russian refugees and soldiers to Turkey. The Bolsheviks for a time renamed Nakhimov Street after Leon Trotsky, but he was soon out of favor, out of Russia, and murdered in exile in Mexico. And when the Soviets finally renamed the street after Nakhimov in 1946, there was very little of Sevastopol left.During World War II, Nazi aviation destroyed the city, leaving fewer than a dozen of the buildings that dated to the reign of Catherine the Great. Soviet leader Josef Stalin then reconstructed Sevastopol’s white edifices.* * *THE SECOND COLD WAR* * *There was no place to exchange foreign currency on the weekend before Unity Day, a Russian national holiday. One could hardly think of another place in Europe where a foreign tourist loaded with U.S. dollars and euros could not pay for a hotel. “Thank the anti-Russian sanctions,” said the receptionist at the elegant Hotel Sevastopol. Since 2014, the flow of Western tourists to Sevastopol has been fading away but the city museums are still filled with Russian–and Ukrainian–visitors. In spite of the Donbas conflict and the U.S. and European Union economic sanctions, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian tourists still travel to Crimea every year; in all, more than six million tourists visited Crimea last year. But American writers and historians who come here experience something of the Cold War, or rather “the Second Cold War,” as our Sevastopol taxi driver joked. Discussions with American journalists by Russian border guards are routine at the checkpoint where one crosses the line from Ukraine; and it can take some time. A majority of Crimea’s tourists violate Ukrainian law, which considers Crimea to be Ukrainian territory. Instead they fly here from Russian airports or drive across the new bridge opened in May 2018 which Moscow now uses to assert control over the militarily and commercially important Sea of Azov. * * *TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES* * *On a recent weekend, dozens of teenagers in blue uniforms who had visited the former Soviet Pioneer Camp Artek came to explore Panorama, the Crimean War museum.Every day Alexander Kuts shows visitors around the museum and speaks of Crimea’s tragic and heroic history. “If you want to know why so much blood spilled on this land, just look at the map: if you control Crimea, you control the Black Sea,” he tells them. Battles have torn this place apart since the 2nd century BC, when Greeks founded the port city of Chersonesus in the outskirts of  what is modern Sevastopol. People died in battles for the peninsula during the Crimean Khanate from 1441 until Catherine the Great’s conquest in 1783 and beyond. In living memory, more than 250,000 Soviet soldiers died defending Sevastopol against the Nazi German and Romanian onslaught in 1941-1942. But the central attraction of the museum is a giant painting of the 349-day defense of Sevastopol and the high Malakoff redoubt. We keep turning back to pages from the 1850s. Two great writers, the British journalist William Howard Russell and the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy had learned from the horrors of Crimea just how much they hated war and the deadly follies of those who prosecuted it.Kings, sultans, tsars, emperors and empresses—they were playing a game of nations with rules inherited from conflicts 40 years, 50 years or a century before. But the death-dealing technology of artillery and riflery had changed dramatically, but the care and feeding of soldiers had not. The combined death toll on all sides in the Crimean War would reach 900,000, mostly from disease and neglect.Crimea in 1854 was right on the cusp of what would become modern industrialized warfare, the kind that killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of Americans five years later in the Civil War and reached its apotheosis in the vast carnage of World War I and World War II.How had the Crimean war begun? With the great powers of the time colliding in the Holy Land.Tsar Nicholas I, harboring imperial ambitions similar to those that Voltaire had admired in Catherine the Great, wanted to push into Ottoman realms, and demanded protection for Orthodox Christians on the territories controlled by the Sultan as well as privileges for the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, especially in Jerusalem. In November 1853, as tensions mounted, a Russian naval squadron attacked and soundly defeated Ottoman warships at anchor in an Anatolian harbor. The French, British, and Sardinians, concerned about broader Russian ambitions, decided to throw their weight behind the Turks. The two great witnesses of the Crimean war, Tolstoy on the Russian side and  William Howard Russell with the British and French, both described the suffering of the soldiers, but it would be Russell’s account of the incredible bravery and utter folly of a British charge directly into the mouths of Russian heavy artillery during the battle of Balaclava in October 1854 that electrified the British public. A vague order issued by a geriatric British general had been misinterpreted by the commander on the ground, who led his men to certain death. The British Light Horse cavalry had begun its advance at “ten minutes past eleven,” Russell wrote at the beginning of his account of his battle. The Russian guns decimated them, but still they charged on. “The first line is broken, it is joined by the second, they never hold or check their speed an instant,” wrote Russell, who could see the battle clearly from a hillside among the commanding officers. “With diminished ranks, thinned by those 30 guns, which the Russians had laid with the most deadly accuracy, with a halo of flashing steel above their heads, and with a cheer that was many a noble fellow’s death-cry, they flew into the smoke of the batteries, but ere they were lost from view the plain was strewn with their bodies and with the carcasses of horses. … At thirty-five minutes past eleven not a British soldier, except the dead and dying, was left in front of those bloody Muscovite guns.”Ever since, schoolchildren in Britain and in the United States as well have read the pounding rhythms of Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poem, “The Charge of the Light Brigade” as a paean to bravery, even though the battle was a paradigm of stupidity.“Forward, the Light Brigade!”Was there a man dismayed?Not though the soldier knew   Someone had blundered.   Theirs not to make reply,   Theirs not to reason why,   Theirs but to do and die.   Into the valley of Death   Rode the six hundred.Vineyards grow today all over the field where October 25, 1854, the cavalry swept past Russell “in all the pride and splendor of war” to inspire with their sacrifice the British and American imagination.  But few in Crimea know the exact location for the memorial at the scene. A small white stela is hiding among the rows of grapes. The fading words on the monument’s foundation commemorate “officers and men” who charged with the Light Brigade at Balaclava. The plaque was installed here in October 2004, the 150th anniversary of the battle, by His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, but judging by the peeling paint, the monument has been abandoned ever since. Compared to the French and Turkish cemeteries here, the British graveyard looks absolutely heartbreaking: an ugly, trashed-filled field surrounded with small private homes.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The review will be led from Johnson’s office at 10 Downing Street, according to a statement on Sunday.His comments, coming days after a terror attack on London Bridge and less than two weeks before the election, are set to sharpen the debate over whether his Conservatives are better placed than the Labour Party to keep the country’s citizens safe.This Time Trump Will Be Just One of The Wild Cards at NATOJohnson’s already promised to stop the automatic early release of people convicted of terror crimes after the suspect in Friday’s stabbing rampage was revealed to be out on parole. Many of the latest polls, taken before the attack, show the Tories still leading but with the gap narrowing.With NATO leaders set for what threatens to be a fractious meeting, Johnson emphasized the need for the military alliance to maintain its unity even as he plots for his country to quit the European Union.“While we are leaving the EU, we must strengthen cooperation with Europe on security,” Johnson said. “The foundation of European security since 1949 has been the NATO and, on its 70th anniversary, we need to modernize it rather than abandon it.”Johnson’s review plan also adds another leg to his party’s manifesto document. Buried on page 48, it promised to set up a commission “to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the Government, Parliament and the courts; the functioning of the Royal Prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people.”Foreign Minister Dominic Raab went a step further than the PM in linking the need to bolster NATO with the fallout from the London Bridge attack. Calling on all NATO members to pay their way, Raab said the organization needs to forge an even stronger Transatlantic unity of purpose.“Ultimately, keeping terror off our streets and deepening our security cooperation with our NATO partners are two sides of the same coin,” Raab wrote in the Daily Telegraph.To contact the reporter on this story: James Ludden in New York at jludden@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Matthew G.

She didn’t yet know, as she crawled into the locker room of her local gym in north London and vomited bile into the toilet, that <em>Game of Thrones</em> would run for seven further seasons, break Emmy-award records for most wins for a scripted television series and for a drama, be named one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and quickly come to define her.

She didn’t know, as she lay on the floor repeating lines from <em>Game of Thrones</em> in order to test her memory, that a third of SAH patients die immediately, or that those who survive require urgent treatment to avoid a second, often fatal bleed. She didn’t know there was another swollen blood vessel in her brain, which had doubled in size by the time she finished filming season three. She didn’t know that one day, eight years later, over biscuits on her pink sofa, she would be smiling with the dark realisation that her stroke was one of the best things that could have happened to her.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/dec/01/emilia-clarke-i-didnt-want-people-to-think-of-me-as-sick-"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/dec/01/emilia-clarke-i-didnt-want-people-to-think-of-me-as-sick-,1/12/2019

The story is woven in the hinterland amid wealth and poverty, love and expediency, this life and the supernatural. It’s silkily enigmatic and unpredictable, and certainly unlike anything else you will see this year.</p><p>It took me a second viewing to engage with the tonal shifts of the story of Ada (Mame Bineta Sane), promised in marriage to a wealthy man, but who loves Souleiman (Ibrahima Traore), a construction worker who disappears at sea in search of a better life. Diop has a keen eye for a poetic image: the film opens with a shot of bustling streets dwarfed by the monstrous, looming haunch of a half-built tower. Later, there’s an achingly pensive shot of the sleeping quarters of the men who have left, their beds still rumpled from warm bodies; bottles of Victory aftershave primed for a night out that will never come. But the lyricism of the photography by Claire Mathon is not matched by the screenplay, which Diop co-wrote with Olivier Demangel and which seems rather flat and declamatory next to the eerie magic of the film’s gauzy light.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/atlantics-review-mati-diop-dakar-love-story-senegal"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/atlantics-review-mati-diop-dakar-love-story-senegal,1/12/2019
